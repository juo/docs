Replacing an item in a subscription with a different item.

## What is a product swap

Swapping a product in [subscription](/docs/glossary/subscription) means replacing that product with a different one that is offered under the same or compatible subscription plan. Swapped products retain the same quantity as the original product in subscription, but may cause the subscriber to lose, e.g. some product-specific discounts.

Product swapping can be used by merchants to periodically switch up what they send with each [subscription order](/docs/glossary/subscription-contract), but it can also be used by [subscribers](/docs/glossary/subscriber) to replace, e.g. products they werenâ€™t able to use up with others. As such, product swapping works as a means to combat subscription fatigue.
