## What is a pause in subscription

Pausing a [subscription](/glossary/subscription) means putting it on hold for a period of time. When a subscription is paused, new [subscriptions orders](/glossary/subscription-order) are not created, billed, processed, or delivered to subscribers. A paused subscription can be resumed by the subscriber in the Customer Portal or by the merchant in the Merchant Portal.

A resumed subscription will renew on its scheduled [renewal](/glossary/subscription-renewal) date, provided that it has been resumed prior to that renewal date (in other words, when it has been paused and resumed within the same subscription cycle).

A resumed subscription will renew immediately, provided that it has been resumed after its original renewal date (in other words, when it has been paused in one subscription cycle and resumed in any subsequent ones).
