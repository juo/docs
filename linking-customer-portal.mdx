As you launch subscriptions in your store, you need to give your subscribers a way to manage their existing subscriptions.

For easier access and management, add the “Manage subscriptions” link to your **Customer account** and (for Legacy Shopify customer accounts) **Customer login** page templates in Shopify. Once added, the link will direct your subscribers to the Customer Portal — an easy-to-use panel, in which all their subscriptions will be visible and available for changes, such as: rescheduling, pausing, renewing etc.

# New Shopify customer accounts

For new customer accounts, you can only place a link to Juo Customer Portal in the top navigation of the customer acount page. To do it, go to [**Content \> Menus**](https://admin.shopify.com/content/menus) and add or edit the Subscriptions menu item. The link to the Juo Customer Portal is always:

`https://<store-handle>.myshopify.com/apps/juo`

To make sure that your customers can switch between their customer account and the Juo Customer Portal without needing to log in, create a [dedicated subdomain](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/domains/add-a-domain/connecting-domains/connect-domain-customer-account) based on your online store's primary domain.

# Legacy Shopify customer accounts
