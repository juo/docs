## What is a subscription order

Subscription order is a recurring order that is placed by a [subscriber](/glossary/subscriber) in an ecommerce store, followed by an automatic renewal.

Placing a subscription order, the customer selects the [subscription](/glossary/subscription) option on the product page, selects the [frequency](/glossary/delivery-frequency) with which they want to receive their orders, then checks out and gets billed for their order. The following subscription orders are placed and billed automatically for the customer, according to the delivery frequency they selected, e.g. two weeks, a month, or couple of months.
