The following guide outlines how to migrate your existing subscriptions to Juo Subscriptions. The process is seamless and designed to preserve customer data, billing schedules, and product associations without requiring action from your subscribers.

The migration consists of four stages:

1. Preparing your store and setting up Juo
2. Launching the Juo widget
3. Migrating your existing subscriptions
4. Finalizing and monitoring the transition

The Juo team will handle the technical aspects of the migration. As a merchant, you will need to coordinate timing and perform some theme-related and configuration steps to ensure a smooth handover.

Your customers will **not** be notified unless you choose to inform them. They will continue to receive their subscriptions without needing to take any action, such as creating a new account.

The main difference for your customers is that they will now use the Juo Customer Portal for managing their subscriptions, and receive Juo email templates if you use them. That's why you should consider notifying your subscribers. 

## Step 1 — Install and set up Juo Subscriptions

Start by setting up Juo Subscriptions on your store. Use our [Getting Started guide](https://juo.io/docs/installing-the-app) to prepare your store for launch and migration.

1. [Install Juo Subscriptions](https://juo.io/docs/installing-the-app) from the Shopify App Store.
2. [Recreate your subscription plans in Juo](https://juo.io/docs/guides/creating-subscription-plan), matching the structure of your current offerings.
3. Set up notifications, integrations, and the customer portal to match your store’s needs.
4. Contact the Juo team to schedule the migration and launch date. This coordination is essential for ensuring a smooth transition.

## Step 2 — Document product setup

If your product setup is changing, create a sheet documenting how SKUs / quantities, etc. should be updated after the migration. This is especially important if migrating from other systems, like WooCommerce. 

## Step 3 — Migrate existing subscriptions

Depending on the subscription platform or database holding the information, the subscriptions and payment methods can be retrieved by an export, or through API. Provide Juo with sufficient permissions so that we are able to retreieve the data. 

During the migration, we’ll ensure that all customer notifications and billing from your previous provider are paused to prevent duplication or confusion.

## Step 4 — Finalization

After the migration:

1. All active subscribers will appear in the Juo Merchant Portal.
2. You’ll be able to track subscription performance immediately in Juo Analytics.
3. Once you've verified the migration is complete and successful, you can deactivate or uninstall your previous subscription app.
