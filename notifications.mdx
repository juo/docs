## Email templates

Once your customers begin their subscription journey, Juo automatically sends them email notifications at key steps. This section allows you to toggle notifications on or off and adjust the message content. Alternatively, you can integrate Juo with Klaviyo to set up a custom subscription notification flow.

The emails are sent from [notify@mail.juo.app](mailto:notify@mail.juo.app), with a reply-to set to the email associated with your Shopify store.

- **Subscription billed** is sent whenever the subscriber is charged
- **Subscription purchased** is sent when the customer starts a new subscription
- **Subscription billing failed** is sent if the payment method fails for any reason
- **Subscription renewal** email is sent X days before the next renewal to give your subscribers a heads up. This trigger can be edited and new can be added in the [Retention tab](https://admin.juo.io/experiences/retention) of the admin panel
- **Subscription billing requires an action** email is sent when the 3-D Secure protocol is activated and necessary to complete the payment.

## SMS notifications

SMS notifications settings let you sent custom text messages to subscribers when their subscription is about to renew. Subscribers can then follow a link to their customer account login page to easily make any changes to their subscriptions.

The message will be sent 3 days before the planned renewal by default, unless the subscribers renews their subscription closer to the planned renewal.

SMS notifications are a PRO feature that is enabled on request. Once you enable it, you’ll be able to customize:

- **“From” field** defines who should be displayed as the sender
- **Message** is the actual text sent to subscriber.

The message also uses smart shorcodes that allow you to include or exclude days to renewal and the login link.
