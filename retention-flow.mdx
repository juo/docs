Retention flow is a set of mechanisms designed to help merchants reduce churn by setting up a customizable cancellation poll with various recovery steps. Integrated with Juo analytics, it enables merchants to understand why customers cancel their subscriptions, and to develop effective strategies to retain them.

Retention flow can be found in Settings > Retention and acquisition

## Cancellation poll

The Cancellation poll is the core component of the Retention flow. It allows merchants to ask subscribers who are about to cancel for their reason and present tailored options based on their responses.

Merchants can customize the displayed message and the possible answers. There is no limit to the number of options, and subscribers can also provide their own answers.

The poll is activated when a subscriber clicks the “Cancel” button in the Customer Portal.

### Recovery steps

Merchants can present different recovery steps based on the subscriber’s response to address their specific concerns:

* **Show Confirmation:** Asks the subscriber if they are sure they want to cancel their subscription.
* **Offer Discount:** Offers a discount to encourage the subscriber to stay.
* **Ask for a Reason:** Allows the subscriber to write their own answer if none of the provided options fit.
* **Change Delivery Interval:** Suggests changing the delivery frequency if the subscriber receives too much or too little.
* **Offer Skip:** Offers the option to skip the next delivery instead of canceling.
* **Offer Pause:** Suggests pausing the subscription until the subscriber is ready to resume.
* **Offer Renew Now:** Allows the subscriber to renew their subscription immediately.
* **Offer Swap Product:** Suggests trying a different product instead of canceling.

### Offer discount

In this section, merchants can set the discount offered to subscribers as an incentive to continue their subscription. The available options include:

* Discount size
* Duration of the discount (permanent or limited number of times)
* A custom message to the customer
* Discount type (percentage or fixed amount - coming soon)
