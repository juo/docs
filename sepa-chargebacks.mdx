<Tip>
Juo has a built-in chargeback dunning flow to help recover lost revenue from failed SEPA Direct Debit payments. If you use SEPA payment methods enabled for subscriptions, you can enable it in Juo **Settings** > **Retention & acquisition**.

For more information about SEPA DD chargebacks, check our [Guide to SEPA Direct Debit](https://www.notion.so/Guide-to-SEPA-Direct-Debit-13c903e568c4805c8ca6f4b51a5da3ac?pvs=21) 

</Tip>

This flow helps recover lost revenue while minimizing failed transactions. Payment providers and banks may charge additional fees for failed SEPA payment transactions (read more in [**Mollie Support**)](https://help.mollie.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000796469-What-is-a-SEPA-Direct-Debit-chargeback).

When a chargeback occurs on a subscription payment, Juo triggers a recovery flow to help merchants receive their renewal payment. Please see the description below to learn how this flow works for recoverable* chargeback reasons.

### What happens after a chargeback?

**Subscription**  
- Status is set to `Failed`

**Order**  
- Automatically refunded  
- Tagged with `chargeback`  
- Duplicated as a new order with a pending payment

**→ Klaviyo receives**  
- Chargeback event with reason code and message  
- Link to Shopify checkout for the duplicated pending order

<Note>
**Action required:** based on the information sent to Klaviyo set up the custom notification that will be sent to customers after chargebacks. See our <a href="/docs/klaviyo-integration" target="_blank">  Klaviyo integration guide.</a> for details
</Note>

**Customer pays for the duplicated order**

- Subscription gets reactivated

<Note>

To view **orders** with chargebacks use Tag filtering in Shopify: `chargeback`


To view **subscriptions** with chargebacks use Status filtering in Juo: `Failed`

</Note>
*Juo retries payments only for recoverable chargeback reasons (e.g., **AM04 – Insufficient funds**). For non-recoverable chargebacks, Juo still sends the chargeback reason to Klaviyo, but then **revokes the payment method**. The customer must start a new subscription with a valid payment method.
