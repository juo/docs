## What is a subscription migration

Subscription migration means transferring the existing [subscription](/glossary/subscription) information to a new management platform, where the legacy and new subscriptions can then be collectively managed.

When handled properly, migration will allow to transfer all the relevant subscription information with no data loss.

## What data is transferred during migration

Migration involves transferring the following data:

- payment information — including payment method and details
- shipping information — including delivery method and price
- subscriber information — including the name, address and email of a [subscriber](/glossary/subscriber)
- subscription information — including the items added to a subscription and delivery frequency
