## What is skip renewal

Skip renewal allows [subscribers](/docs/glossary/subscribers) to manually skip the upcoming delivery in their [subscription](/docs/glossary/subscription) â€” and so to adjust the frequency of the payments and deliveries to their current needs.

A customer who skips a renewal is not charged for their [subscription order](/docs/glossary/subscription-order) until the next subscription cycle begins. Their order is also processed and sent one subscription cycle later as a result.
