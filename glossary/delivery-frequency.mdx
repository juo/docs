## What is delivery frequency

Delivery frequency is the frequency with which [subscription orders](/docs/glossary/subscription-order) are sent to [subscribers](/docs/glossary/subscriber). When subscribing to a product or service, the subscriber typically selects the delivery frequency that suits them the best from the delivery options defined by the merchant.

The available delivery frequency options can range from a daily, weekly or bi-weekly, to monthly or even anuual deliveries, and depend on the products or services being offered by the merchant as well as the types of subscription offer they have made available in their store.

For example, for subscribe & save subscriptions, the delivery frequency is usually the same as the billing frequency, whereas for prepaid subscriptions, the delivery frequency is greater than the billing frequency.
