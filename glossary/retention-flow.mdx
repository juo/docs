###### Full definition

## What is a retention flow

Retention flow refers to the part of the [subscription](/docs/glossary/subscription) experience that helps merchants retain their current [subscribers](/docs/glossary/subscriber) and prevent them from [cancelling](/docs/glossary/subscription-cancellation).

Retention flow is linked to a subscription cancellation attempt, after which subscribers are offered an incentive (such as an extra discount, free gift, etc.) that will be added to their subscriptions if they decide not to cancel.

The incentives can be offered alongside a survey that asks the subscribers about the reason for cancellation, like too many products they couldnâ€™t use up, not happy with the product in the long term, etc. The survey is not specifically aimed to retain, but to give merchants more information on the possible issues their subscribers may experience and to adjust their subscription offer accordingly.
