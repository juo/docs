The Setting tab lets you change a range of global settings to further customize your customers’ subscription experience.

## Out of stock items

This section lets you manage what should happen when there is an out-of-stock item in a subscription. It can either be suspended until all items are back in stock, or it can renew normally without interruption.

## Price changes

This section lets you choose whether the products in existing subscriptions should be affected by price changes in your inventory.

## SMS notifications

SMS notifications is a PRO feature enabled on request. Once enabled, it allows you to customize the notification for upcoming subscription renewals with custom sender and text fields. You can also use smart shortcodes to show the number of days until renewal and add a login link that lets your subscribers easily manage their subscription on their phones.

## Email Templates

Once your customers begin their subscription journey, Juo automatically sends them email notifications at key steps. This section allows you to toggle notifications on or off and adjust the message content. Alternatively, you can integrate Juo with Klaviyo to set up a custom subscription notification flow.

## Subscription intent

Subscription intent detection is a PRO feature that analyzes returning customers’ buying behaviors to identify potential subscribers. When enabled, it scans your order base and automatically tags customers who have purchased the same product variant at least twice. You can then use this tag to create targeted customer segments.

## Cancellation flow

This section lets you set up a cancellation flow, including the cancellation message and suggested reasons. You can also offer an extra discount to customers who decide to cancel—the discount can be applied to selected upcoming renewals or permanently.

The Customer Portal automatically adjusts to your theme settings, allowing you to further refine colors and button shapes to match your store’s design.
