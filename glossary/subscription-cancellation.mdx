## What is cancellation in subscription

Subscription cancellation equals to changing the status of a [subscription](/glossary/subscription) from active to inactive. Inactive subscription will not renew, so no subsequent [orders](/glossary/subscription-orders) will ever be placed, billed, processed or sent within it.

A subscription can be cancelled manually by [subscribers](/glossary/subscribers) or merchants in the [Customer Portal](/glossary/customer-portal) or [Merchant Portal](/glossary/merchant-portal). A subscription can also cancel automatically after all the scheduled [dunning](/glossary/dunning) attempts have failed.

Unlike [pauses](/glossary/subscription-pause), [cancellations](/glossary/subscription-cancellation) canâ€™t usually be revoked by subscribers, but the possibility to reactivate a subscription is sometimes given to the merchants.
