Extending a subscription for another period.

###### Full definition

## What is a renewal in subscription

Renewal is an automatic or manual extension of an active [subscription](/docs/glossary/subscription) that causes a new [subscription order](/docs/glossary/subscription-order) to be placed. [Renewal](/docs/glossary/subscription-renewal) marks the beginning of a new subscription cycle and allows to keep the subscription for the length of that cycle (provided itâ€™s not cancelled manually before the cycle ends).

Renewals only occur in subscriptions, [subscription boxes](/docs/glossary/subscription-box), and [memberships](/docs/glossary/memberships), which sets them apart from regular, one-time orders.

## What are two types of subscription renewals

There are two types of renewal: automatic and manual.

**Automatic renewals** or auto-renewals allow for a subscription to be automatically renewed at the beginning of each subscription cycle. Thanks to that, a subscription will continue to be active and the [subscriber](/docs/glossary/subscriber) will keep access to their subscription products or services without interruptions.

**Manual renewals** occur when a merchant or a subscriber renew a subscription in the [Merchant Portal](/docs/glossary/merchant-portal) or [Customer Portal](/docs/glossary/customer-portal) manually, usually in the middle of a subscription cycle. The subscription then renews immediately, resetting the billing cycle to start on the manual renewal date.
