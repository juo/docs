## Subscriptions configuration

### How can I make a product available only as a subscription?
On the product page in Shopify, enable **Only sell this product as a subscription**.

If you use a custom widget (not the default Juo widget), developers may need to adjust it to reflect this setting.

### Why aren’t Build-a-Box selling plans visible?
Make sure all products included in the Build-a-Box are also included in the relevant selling plans, and that all products share the **same plan frequencies**.

Mismatched frequencies prevent plans from displaying.

### Why are there two checkout buttons in the cart (for local payment methods)?
For non-Shopify Plus, this is needed to route customers into the right checkout and payment method setup.

On Shopify Plus it is not needed.

### How is the order of selling plans determined in the widget?
Selling plans appear in the **order they are added** in Juo.

To change the order, re-add them in the desired sequence.

### Can I enable subscriptions only for selected countries?
Yes.

**Set up a payment profile** and have it connected to subscription orders via API.

### Do subscriptions work with bundled products?
Not by default.

Shopify Bundles do not support selling plans. According to [Shopify docs](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/product-merchandising/bundles#store-configurations), bundles can be sold only through the Online Store channel and **cannot use selling plans**.

Alternative solutions require a custom frontend implementation.

### How can I restrict quantity for subscription purchases?
For regular subscriptions, use product page and cart validation to enforce **quantity limits** when a recurring selling plan is present.

In Juo Build-a-Box, use the built-in quantity restriction feature.

### Can a selling plan automatically adjust product quantity?
Not strictly via Juo.

You can implement a small customization, such as checking the selected selling plan on Add to Cart and **adjusting quantity**, or using a custom button that sets both the selling plan and quantity.

### How do I set up a “welcome kit” workflow where Product A ships first and Product B recurs?
Create a **custom workflow** with Product A as the triggering product (set as a physical product in Shopify).

Leave Cycle 1 empty.

Add Product B to Cycle 2 and set **When cycle is complete: Continue subscription with products from the final step.**

### Can I show the one-time option above subscription in the widget, not below?
Yes.

In your Shopify theme, open the Juo widget settings and add the following to **Custom CSS**:

```

.j-widget {

display: flex;

flex-direction: column-reverse;

}

```

## Customer Management

### How does the Juo Customer Portal differ from the Shopify customer account?
They are independent accounts linked only by the **same email address**.

When a purchase is made, a Shopify customer is created. The Juo account is created at the first subscription purchase.

Logging into Shopify allows access to Juo without an additional login.

### Can I view the customer portal exactly as a customer?
Yes.

In Juo, open a specific subscription and click **Generate customer portal link**.

### How can a customer change their delivery address?
Customers can update their address in the Customer Portal.

If they previously selected a pickup point instead of providing a home address, they cannot edit the delivery method. **Change the delivery method on the merchant side** and add the home address.

### Can two Shopify customer accounts be merged if one has an active subscription?
No.

Shopify does not allow **merging accounts with an active subscription**.

The workaround is to cancel the subscription on the incorrect account and re-create it on the correct account.

### How can I send customers a link to purchase a new subscription?
Use this permalink structure and replace values (remove curly braces):

```

https://your-store.myshopify.com/cart/add?id={VARIANT_ID}&quantity={QUANTITY}&selling_plan={SELLING_PLAN_ID}

```

For multiple products, use:

```

[https://yourstore.com/cart/add?items[0][id]=VARIANT_ID_1&items[0][quantity]=QTY_1&items[0][selling_plan]=SELLING_PLAN_1&items[1][id]=VARIANT_ID_2&items[1][quantity]=QTY_2&items[1][selling_plan]=SELLING_PLAN_2](https://yourstore.com/cart/add?items[0][id]=VARIANT_ID_1&items[0][quantity]=QTY_1&items[0][selling_plan]=SELLING_PLAN_1&items[1][id]=VARIANT_ID_2&items[1][quantity]=QTY_2&items[1][selling_plan]=SELLING_PLAN_2)

```

Selling plan IDs can be found by **inspecting the selling plans dropdown** on the product page.

### How is the notifications language chosen, and can I change it?
Notifications are automatically translated based on the **language selected by the customer** during their visit.

To change the language for a specific customer, adjust it at the user level in Shopify settings.

## Payments and Billing

### Can I use iDEAL/Bancontact without Mollie?
You need Mollie for iDEAL/Bancontact subscriptions, but you can still use other gateways (Shopify Payments, Stripe) for card, PayPal, and one-time purchases.

### Why is a payment taking so long (e.g., 2 days)?
Payments via SEPA by default take **24-48 hours** to complete.

To avoid delays in order fulfilment, you can trigger the payments 2 days before the renewal date. You can enable this option in the [Retention settings](https://admin.juo.io/experiences/retention).

### Why are discounts not working for iDEAL payments?
Shopify treats iDEAL and Bancontact as **one-time purchases**.

Configure discounts to apply to both one-time and subscription purchases in order for them to be applied to iDEAL subscriptions.

### How do I include the chargeback-flow checkout link in Klaviyo?
Use the property `event.paymentLink`.

The link is available in **Analytics → Metrics → Chargeback subscription → Activity feed**.

### Why was an order automatically charged back?
Some accounts don’t allow SEPA Direct Debit.

**Check your Mollie account** and see [Mollie docs](https://help.mollie.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115000309865-Why-did-my-SEPA-direct-debit-payment-fail). Additional details are in [Juo SEPA docs](https://juo.io/docs/sepa-direct-debit).

Mollie marks payments as processed before they are fully authenticated by the bank. It’s possible that the payment is initially processed, but gets automatically revoked by the bank 1-2 days later.

### Why are SEPA chargebacks processed automatically, and can we charge again?
SEPA allows chargebacks up to **90 days**, and Shopify does not allow charging again for the same order after a chargeback.

To recover revenue, use our [chargeback recovery flow](https://juo.io/docs/sepa-chargebacks#sepa-chargebacks-recovery).

If the refund was requested by the customer, proceed cautiously to avoid fraud risk.

### Can I update PayPal via a Shopify payment update link?
Yes.

Updating via the Shopify link allows **updating PayPal** as well.

### Why don’t iDEAL/Bancontact subscriptions show as subscriptions in Shopify analytics (recurring revenue)?
Shopify treats these as one-time orders on the Shopify side, even though they behave as subscriptions in Juo.

## Discounts and Retention

### What’s the best way to apply a discount to the first subscription order?
Use a **variable discount** in Subscribe & Save to apply the discount only to the first order.

### How can I apply a discount code only to the first subscription order?
This cannot be done directly in Juo.

Use a **third-party app or custom code**.

### Can Memberships grant discounts or free delivery?
Yes.

After purchasing a Membership product, Juo assigns the tag `membership_active` to the customer.

Use this tag in Shopify segments to provide discounts or free shipping, and to disable other benefits if needed.

Customers must be logged in for benefits to apply.

### How can I reduce cancellations and improve retention?
Enable or optimize the **cancellation poll** in Settings → Retention & Acquisition.

Review results in Analytics → Retention Flow.

Check Analytics → Cohort Retention to identify when subscribers tend to cancel, then use Extras, Upsells, or loyalty incentives to retain them.

See the in-depth [guide on increasing retention]([juo-io.notion.site](http://juo-io.notion.site)-33) for more ideas.

### Will a Buy X Get Y discount work with Juo?
Shopify native Buy X Get Y discounts do not work with **fixed selling plans**.

Buy X Get Y discounts set up in dedicated apps will work properly.

### How can I combine a Build-a-Box discount with a Shopify discount code?
In Shopify, allow the discount code to **combine with product discounts**.

In Juo, configure the Build-a-Box discount to combine with order discounts.

### If I limit a Shopify discount to the first payment, does it also apply to active subscriptions?
Yes.

The discount will also apply to an **active subscription**, not just the initial checkout.

## Managing Subscriptions and Orders

### Why can’t I edit a subscription?
Most likely, the subscription is **in the process of renewing** and the payment is being processed.

Subscriptions in this status cannot be modified until the payment renewal completes. Once the renewal succeeds, the next order can be edited, and refunds or product changes can be applied.

It’s also possible that a **minimum number of renewals** is required. Until it’s met, changes or removals are blocked (if necessary, you can manually change the cycle of the subscription).

Finally, check the **next renewal date** and make sure it’s in the future.

### Why isn’t the estimated order date displayed?
For credit card subscriptions, the order date equals the **payment date**, so the estimated order date is not shown.

For payment methods with longer processing times (for example, SEPA), an estimated order date is displayed.

### Why do items within one subscription have different renewal dates?
A subscription can include items with **different renewal dates and frequencies**, which can generate separate orders on different days.

### Why did the first order include a duplicate free item?
This is likely related to custom workflows.

If the parent product is included in the workflow and the same product is added to Cycle 1, enable **Fulfil parent product automatically** to prevent duplicates.

### Can I permanently delete a subscription?
No.

You cannot delete a subscription entirely or remove all products from it.

To prevent reactivation, set the subscription status to **Expired**.

### Can I change a customer’s email address in Juo?
No.

Juo reads the email from the Shopify customer account.

**Update the email in Shopify** → Customer → Edit contact information.

### Why did a subscription reach the renewal date, but no order was created?
This can happen after migrations if the customer record contains data that Shopify does not accept (for example, an email domain).

The subscription may appear migrated successfully, but **Shopify can still refuse to process the order**.

Alerts for these situations are shown in the Activity Log.

### Can subscription data be exported automatically to a spreadsheet?
Yes.

Use the **Customer API** to push subscription data to a spreadsheet.

### If I remove a selling plan, will it affect active subscriptions?
No.

Selling plans control what’s available for purchase in the store.

**Active subscriptions are not affected** by removing or adjusting selling plans.

### Will removing a product in Shopify break subscriptions that include this product?
Yes.

Removing the product will **break existing subscriptions** that include it.

Bulk-swap the product in existing subscriptions before removing it in Shopify.

## Shipping and Fulfilment

### How can I change the shipping method for all subscription orders?
Customers choose the shipping method for the first order.

For renewals, Shopify assigns the **cheapest available method** automatically (or, in case of multiple methods with the same price, the first one alphabetically).

To influence selection, rename methods to prioritize one or ask the Juo support to set a dedicated shipping profile for subscription renewals.

### Why is the shipping price wrong?
This is often caused by **missing locations** in the shipping profile.

Make sure all relevant locations are added.

### Why can’t customers purchase out-of-stock items?
In Juo settings, enable **General → Renew subscription when out of stock**.

Consider disabling the out-of-stock notification in Settings → Notifications so customers don’t receive alerts when the subscription will renew anyway.

### How can I make a product unavailable in the store but keep renewals running?
**Unpublish the product** on the online store and hide the purchase button on the product page.

### Is in-store pickup supported for subscriptions?
Not yet.

Juo doesn’t currently support **in-store pickup** as a recurring shipping method.

### How does Juo handle multiple fulfilment locations?
If at least one location has stock, Shopify marks the item as **in stock.**

Order allocation across inventories is controlled by Shopify.

For advanced handling, consider Shopify Functions or consult your fulfilment partner.

### What happens if multiple subscriptions renew on the same day?
If renewals occur within **24 hours**, Juo merges orders and counts shipping once.

## Other

### How do I cancel my Juo plan?
**Uninstalling the Juo app** in Shopify automatically cancels the associated Juo subscription.

### Why can’t I see Juo-related triggers and events in Klaviyo?
After you integrate with Klaviyo, triggers and events will populate only after they occur within Juo.

To push them into Klaviyo, it’s a good idea to set up a test subscription and perform multiple actions on it to push data into Klaviyo.

### Why aren’t tags being pushed to the logistics center?
There may be a timing delay when the tag is applied.

Ask the logistics center to add a short processing delay.

If that does not help, consider an app such as [Gifter – Cart Auto Include](https://apps.shopify.com/gifter-cart-auto-include) or add the gift via Extras in Juo.

### Why don’t analytics show new subscribers for a given day?
**Time zone differences** may cause discrepancies.

Verify the merchant’s location and the Shopify store time zone settings.
