## SMS notifications

SMS notifications settings let you sent custom text messages to subscribers when their subscription is about to renew. Subscribers can then follow a link to their customer account login page to easily make any changes to their subscriptions.

The message will be sent 3 days before the planned renewal by default, unless the subscribers renews their subscription closer to the planned renewal.

SMS notifications are a PRO feature that is enabled on request. Once you enable it, you’ll be able to customize:

* **“From” field** defines who should be displayed as the sender
* **Message** is the actual text sent to subscriber.

The message also uses smart shorcodes that allow you to include or exclude days to renewal and the login link.

The emails are sent from [notify@mail.juo.app](mailto:notify@mail.juo.app), with a reply-to set to the email associated with your Shopify store.
