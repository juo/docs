## What is a variable discount

Variable discount is a loyalty benefit, granted by merchants to [subscribers](/glossary/subscribers) after theyâ€™ve reached a required number of [renewals](/glossary/subscription-renewal). It usually takes the form of a percent off discount on all products in a [subscription](/glossary/subscription).

Variable discount can increase once in the subscription lifecycle, or increase progressively with each renewal. For example, it can increase once, from 5% to 10%, after the 3rd renewal, or it can increase ten times, from 1% to 10%, after each subsequent renewal.
