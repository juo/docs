## What are dynamic boxes

A feature in Juo that allows merchants to build personalized and adaptive subscription experiences with total flexibility and automation.

The dynamic boxes flow is triggered on product purchase and lets merchants use a set of conditions and actions to craft unique SKU swapping sequences, build starter kit + replenishment offers, or add free products or extra discounts to [subscriptions](/glossary/subscription) for increased loyalty and retention.

Using tags to label their subscriptions, merchants can also adjust the content of [subscription orders](/glossary/subscription-order) based on [subscriber](/glossary/subscriber) segments, so that subscribers with different sets of tags will also receive different products in their orders.
