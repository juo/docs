We’ll cover setting up subscription offers, configuring your storefront, managing customer communication, and using the Customer Portal. If you’re switching from another provider, we’ll also guide you through the migration process.

# Install Juo Subscriptions app

To get started, install [Juo Subscriptions](https://apps.shopify.com/juo-subscriptions) from the Shopify App Store and select your billing plan.

# Subscription Experiences

Experiences are a core component of Juo Subscriptions. They determine every step of a subscription journey from the initial purchase to renewals.

## Subscribe & Save

Use [Subscribe & Save](https://juo.io/docs/guides/creating-subscription-plan) to set up a classic subscription experience. A customer can opt in to subscribe to a product on the product page. Next orders will be created automatically at a frequency chosen by the customer in the subscription widget.

## Build-a-box

[Build-a-box](https://juo.io/docs/guides/adding-build-a-box) is a primarly forntend experience where customers can build their own subscription box and earn rewards based on their order size.

## Custom workflows

Not all subscriptions rely on shipping the same product to a customer every month. [Custom workflows](https://juo.io/docs/guides/custom-workflows) let you design custom subscription sequences with alternating SKUs, frequencies, discounts, and more.

## Curated boxes

[Curated boxes](https://juo.io/docs/guides/setting-up-curated-boxes) are best if you’d like to to pick a product (or products) that go into each delivery month to month. Best for curated and mystery boxes, where you want to keep things fresh and not plan too far ahead.

## Memberships

Best for non-physical products and benefits. With [Memberships](https://juo.io/docs/guides/setting-up-memberships) you can offer site-wide discounts, free shipping, access to digital services and more.

# Communication

Juo registers important events in the course of as a subscription lifetime and lets you sent related notifications to your subscribers. When set properly, notifications will help you reduce tickets and churn, and even grow AOV and LTV metrics.

## Built-in notification emails

[Email notifications](https://juo.io/docs/guides/setting-subscription-notifications) settings let you customize emails that your customers receive during the different stages of their subscription. You are free to modify the text of these emails, as well as the translations. All emails include the subscription preview and a link to managing the subscription.

## Klaviyo integration

If you’d like to freely customize the subscription email flow, use [Juo \<> Klaviyo integration](https://juo.io/docs/guides/klaviyo-integration). Juo will send events, tags and subscription properties to Klaviyo where you can build your campaign from ground up.

## Quick actions

Quick actions are one-click actions that can be embedded in email templates to allow customers to manage their subscriptions without logging in. They come with properties that can be used in email campaigns to let customers perform tasks like adding products, discounts, or updating their details.

# Completing setup

## General settings

Make sure to go through general settings to decide how existing subscriptions should behave upon changed product prices or shipping rates. Also, choose what should happen if there is an out-of-stock item in a subscription.

## Customer portal

Customer Portal is a space for subscription customers where they can safely access and manage their subscriptions on any device, independently of their Shopify customer account. Upon logging in, subscribers can, for example, speed up the next delivery, swap the items in their subscription, pause their subscription, etc.

## Migration from other platforms

Juo makes it possible to [migrate subscribers](https://juo.io/docs/guides/migrating-to-juo) from other subscription apps. The process differs slightly depending on the source platform, but in each case the transfer is white-glove, lossless and smooth.

# Next steps

Completing these steps means that you are ready to start selling subscriptions. It is a good practice to start a test subscription and go through the customer journey yourself to make ensure the subscriber experience is clear and consistent.
