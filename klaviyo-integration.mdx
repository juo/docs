</Frame>
Juo provides out-of-the box email notifications for subscription purchase, renewal, upcoming payment, failed payment, cancellation, and pending renewal (items out of stock).

In addition to these automatic notifications, or instead of them, merchants can also integrate Juo with Klaviyo to manage their subscription-related communication there.

Before using Klaviyo integration, [enable it in the Juo settings](/docs/enable-klaviyo-integration).

## Juo \<> Klaviyo Flow triggers

Juo is currently syncing the following events with Klaviyo:

<Warning>
Note that in order to sync events between Juo and Klaviyo you need to turn on the integration first. Events that happened prior to the integration will not be visible in Klaviyo.
</Warning>

You can use the above events as triggers to send subscription notifications. For example, if you want to send an email after a subscription has been purchased in your store, select “Subscription started” as a trigger.

## Customer tags as flow filters

Apart from events that act as triggers, you can also use tags to limit the email flow to specific subscriber segments.

Juo automatically tags subscription and membership customers with different tags, depending on the type of subscription, its status, and the number of subscription orders.

#### Tags assigned to subscription customers:
<Warning>
Note that these tags are configurable in the Juo admin panel's [general settings](https://admin.shopify.com/apps/juo-subscriptions/settings/general), so always refer to your current setup.
</Warning>

**Status tags:**

| Tag name                | Description                                                  |
|:------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **active_subscriber**   | Customer with active subscription                            |
| **paused_subscriber**   | Customer with paused subscription                            |
| **cancelled_subscriber**| Customer with cancelled subscription                         |
| **failed_subscriber**   | Customer with failed subscription payment                    |
| **expired_subscriber**  | Customer whose subscription auto-expired due to its schedule |

**Loyalty tags:**

| Tag name                | Description                                                  |
|:------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **new_subscriber**      | Customer with only first subscription order                  |
| **recurring_subscriber**| Customer with renewed subscription                           |
| **returning_subscriber**| Customer with at least two separate subscriptions            |

**Membership tags:**
| Tag name                | Description                                                  |
|:------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **membership\_active**  | Customers with an active membership                          |
| **membership\_inactive**| Customers with an inactive membership                        |

A subscriber will only have one tag per tag group assigned at any give time.

#### Tags assigned to potential subscribers

Based on their order history, customers can also be assigned the **subscription\_intent** tag, which allows merchants to convert them to subscribers more easily with targeted messaging.

[Subscription intent tagging](/docs/guides/using-global-settings#subscription-intent) is a PRO feature that can be enabled under **Settings** > **Subscription intent**.

All the above tags can be used as flow filters in Klaviyo — they can be found under **Flow filter** > **Properties about someone** > **Shopify Tags**.
<Frame caption="Subscriber tags can also be used as filters">
