## What is a one-time purchase

One-time purchase is a mode of selling products alternative to [subscriptions](/glossary/subscription). While [subscription orders](/glossary/subscription-order) auto-renew with each billing cycle after the original purchase, one-time orders are only placed and billed once and are not followed by a renewal.

Merchants who only allow for one-time purchases and don’t enable subscriptions need to rely more on new customer acquisition, tend to have lower percentage of returning customers, as well as lower [LTV](/glossary/lifetime-value), as opposed to those who offer subscriptions in their stores.

Although some merchants may rely on either one-time purchases or subscriptions, it’s also common to use both modes at the same time.
