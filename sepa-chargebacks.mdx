title: "SEPA chargebacks recovery"
---

Juo includes built-in **chargeback recovery features** to help recover lost revenue from failed SEPA Direct Debit subscription payments. To better understand how SEPA payments and chargebacks work, see our SEPA guide.

You can enable and configure chargeback recovery in the **[Retention tab](https://admin.juo.io/experiences/retention)** of your Juo admin.

Regardless of whether a dunning flow is enabled, **any SEPA chargeback** triggers the following actions:

1. The order is refunded and tagged with `chargeback`.
2. The subscription status is changed to **Failed**.
3. A **Chargeback Subscription** event is sent to Klaviyo, including the chargeback reason.

## Chargeback Dunning Flow

For certain **recoverable chargeback reasons**, Juo can initiate a recovery (dunning) flow via Klaviyo.

When chargeback dunning is enabled, Juo will:

1. Create a **duplicate draft order** for the failed payment.
2. Include a **Shopify checkout link** in the **Chargeback Subscription** event sent to Klaviyo.
3. Automatically **reactivate the subscription** if the customer successfully pays the duplicated order.

**Action required:**
Use this event in Klaviyo to build an automated recovery flow that asks customers to complete payment for the pending order.
See the **[Klaviyo integration guide](https://juo.io/docs/klaviyo-integration)** for implementation details.

## Auto-Retry for Insufficient Funds (AM04)

For chargebacks caused by **insufficient funds (AM04)**, Juo supports an optional **auto-retry** mechanism that attempts to recover the payment before triggering Klaviyo dunning.

When auto-retry is enabled, Juo will:

1. Attempt to **re-charge the customer’s existing SEPA mandate** after a fixed delay.
2. Retry the charge multiple times before marking the subscription as failed.
3. Only fall back to the Klaviyo dunning flow if all retry attempts are exhausted.

This helps recover payments automatically without customer involvement, especially for temporary balance issues.

### How Auto-Retry Works

1. An AM04 chargeback occurs.
2. The original order is refunded and a draft replacement order is created.
3. Juo schedules a retry using the existing SEPA mandate.
4. If the retry succeeds:

   * The draft order is completed.
   * The subscription continues without interruption.
5. If the retry fails with AM04:

   * The next retry is scheduled.
6. If all retries fail:

   * The payment method is revoked.
   * The **Chargeback Subscription** event is sent to Klaviyo to trigger the dunning flow.

### Configuration

* **Retry interval:** Fixed at 3 days
* **Maximum retries:** Configurable per shop (1–10, default: 3)
* **Supported reason:** AM04 (insufficient funds) only
* **Other chargeback reasons:** Follow the standard Klaviyo dunning flow

Auto-retry can be enabled from the **Retention settings**, where you can toggle the feature and define the maximum number of retry attempts.

If you want, next good steps would be:

* adding a **small “When should I use auto-retry?” callout** for merchants, or
* tightening language around **which chargeback reasons are recoverable** vs final, to reduce support questions.
