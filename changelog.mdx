<Update label="2025-02-07" description="Public Admin API">
  ![Admin API](/assets/updates/2025-02-07/admin-api.png)

We're introducing our new Public Admin API this week, designed to give merchants and their developers greater flexibility and control over the subscription experience and management.

Juo is built with an API-first approach. We've been refining the core structure of our API to deliver a version that enables future expansion and new capabilities. Today, we're excited to release the polished version of the public Admin API.

Developers can now leverage the advanced Search Query Language to construct complex searches, allowing for more precise data retrieval and subscription management. Juo API is versioned to maintain stability. No breaking changes will be made to existing versions, providing a reliable foundation for use of the Juo Admin API.

We're committed to continuously expanding the API by adding more resources, ensuring it evolves to support various business cases.

<Update label="2024-12-13" description="Quick actions">
  ![Quick actions](/assets/updates/2024-12-13/quick-actions.png)

This week we're launching Quick actions — a feature that allows customers to perform subscription actions directly from email. Merchants can now send email campaigns with one-click actions, making subscription management easier by eliminating the need to log in and context switch.

Quick actions are properties sent to Klaviyo 3 days before a renewal date. Merchants can use them to redirect customers to specific views in Customer Portal or enable one-click actions like Skip or Add product. For security reasons links and actions expire after 72 hours.

Quick links

- View subscription

- Change payment method
- Change billing date
- Add discount

<Update label="2024-11-29" description="Upsell Personalization">
  ![Upsell personalization](/assets/updates/2024-11-29/upsell-personalization.png)

Customer lifetime value is a crucial metric for subscription businesses. While there are many strategies to increase LTV, they must be tailored to specific customer segments to be effective.

This week, we're launching important new settings in the Juo Upsell experience that allow merchants to create targeted upsell campaigns based on Customer Segments and subscribed products. Merchants can now create campaigns for specific subscribers by filtering them using Shopify segments or their subscribed products.

To set up the personalized Upsell campaign go to Experiences > Upsell

<Update label="2024-11-22" description="SEPA Direct Debit — early renewal initiation">
  ![SEPA Direct Debit early renewals](/assets/updates/2024-11-22/sepa-renewals.png)

Juo enables subscription renewals through SEPA Direct Debit for European merchants. As an account-to-account (A2A) payment method, SEPA Direct Debit operates differently from credit cards, potentially leading to longer transaction times and affecting renewal timing.

To improve the renewal experience with SEPA DD, we launched an option to schedule transactions before the renewal date. When enabled, this feature triggers the recurring payment 2 working days before the actual renewal date. This lowers the risk associated with SEPA's extended transaction processing times. As a result, customers receive their subscribed products on time.

To schedule payments earlier than the renewal date, go to Settings > Retention and acquisition > SEPA Direct Debit renewals. This feature is available for all merchants using local payment methods with SEPA Direct Debit for subscriptions.

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added a fallback to primary shop locale when customer's locale is not supported by the renewal flow

We're thrilled to announce the first AI feature in Juo. Now, merchants can create subscription plans directly from a natural language description. Juo AI will take care of setting up the plan for you.

<Update label="2024-10-18" description="Subscribers Dashboard">
  ![Subscribers dashboard](/assets/updates/2024-10-18/subscribers-dashboard.png)

For the past few weeks, we've been working on updating our data tracking to include more metrics and activity information in Analytics. This week, we're introducing a new dashboard — Subscribers.

In the Subscribers analytics, merchants can find new customer-related metrics such as lifetime value, average orders per subscriber, and subscriber churn rate. Additionally, for a selected reporting period, merchants can see how many subscribers are new, paused, expired, churned, or reactivated.

Subscriber activity can be analyzed day by day on a new chart, with more details available on hover. To check out the new dashboard, go to Analytics > Subscribers

</Update>

<Update label="2024-10-04" description="Improved Performance">
  Over the past few weeks, we've focused on enhancing the overall performance of our subscriptions' data layer and improving synchronization between Juo and Shopify. Subscriptions in Juo serve as the source of truth and contain information not natively available in Shopify's Subscription API. Orders are generated from subscription contracts stored in Shopify. This dual-location setup makes it crucial to maintain perfect synchronization between the two platforms.

Previously, we used a centralized subscription updating process that simultaneously updated both Juo's database and Shopify's subscription contract. Updating Shopify's data consumed approximately 90% of the total update time.

We've now enhanced the update process, which allowed us to safely relocate subscription contract update to a background job. This job performs the reconciliation process without blocking the synchronous update process. As a result, subscription updates in both the Merchant Portal and the Customer Portal should now operate up to 10 times faster.

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added support for redeeming discount codes on subscriptions with alternative payment methods
- Added the "Add product" bulk action to Subscriptions page in the Merchant Portal
- Added "Remove product" to Bulk Actions on Subscriptions page in the Merchant Portal

<Update label="2024-09-27" description="SEPA Chargebacks and Refund Details on Subscription Timeline">
  ![Chargebacks and refund details on Subscription Timeline](/assets/updates/2024-09-27/subscription-timeline-chargeback.png)

Chargebacks and refunds are an inevitable part of subscriptions in e-commerce. With account-to-account (A2A) payments like SEPA Direct Debit, chargebacks are especially challenging as they can be triggered for various reasons—not necessarily directly by a customer, but also due to insufficient funds.

To help merchants better handle customers with chargebacks, we're adding new information to the Subscription Timeline and Activity Log. This new information will provide details about when a chargeback occurs, the exact reason for it, and ID of the order related to the chargeback.

We're also adding information about refunds created by merchants, including details about their status and related orders.

As a next step, we will add an option to filter subscriptions with chargebacks and introduce custom dunning flows based on the chargeback reason. This will help merchants reclaim their revenue more effectively.

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added merchant notifications after chargeback is created
- Added LTV and Total Churn Rate metrics to Analytics page in the Merchant Portal

  This week we've been working on additional options for creating subscription offers to make Juo even more flexible. Two noteworthy features are: a new rule to change frequency in Custom Workflows and fixed amount discounts in Build-a-Box.

  ![Bulk actions on subscriptions](/assets/updates/2024-07-26/bulk-actions.png)

  ![Advanced filtering](/assets/updates/2024-07-12/advanced-filters.gif)

Success in subscriptions depends on many factors, and one of them is smooth day-to-day operations. Ecommerce managers and customer support representatives need easy access and flexibility to manage subscriptions. Any friction they encounter can result in a negative subscriber experience.

This week we’re launching advanced filtering to ensure seamless subscription management. The available filters are:
Subscription status
Created at date
Next renewal date
Last renewal date
Delivery frequency
Payment method
Product

<Update label="2024-06-28" description="Retention Flow: new recovery steps">
  ![Recovery steps](/assets/updates/2024-06-28/recovery-steps.png)

Over the past few weeks, we've focused on enhancing our Retention Flow to make each subscription count. This week, we're taking it a step further by expanding the range of recovery steps merchants can take when customers are about to cancel.

Previously, to win back subscribers who were about to cancel, merchants could ask for feedback or offer a discount. Now, they can also offer options to Skip, Pause, Renew Now, Swap Product or Change Delivery Frequency.

What's more, each option can be linked to a specific poll response. For example, if a subscriber wants to cancel because they’re going on vacation, offer them to skip the next delivery. If they've run out early, let them order immediately. And if all else fails, a good old discount might do the trick.

All cancellation reasons and the effectiveness of each strategy can be tracked in the Analytics tab, allowing merchants to fine-tune their approach and maximize customer lifetime value.

The new recovery steps are available on all plans and you'll find them in Settings > Retention and acquisition.

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added an option to disable order processing from checkout (first purchase) in Curated Boxes

- Fixed an issue where the Checkout block was not displayed on the Shopify Thank You Page and Order Status Page

<Update label="2024-06-14" description="Retention Flow performance dashboard">
  ![Retention Flow performance](/assets/updates/2024-06-14/retention-flow-performance.png)

Each cancelled subscription is a major challenge for every DTC brand. Fortunately, with the right tools and strategy, it can be avoided.

Starting this week, merchants will find a new Retention Flow performance dashboard in the Analytics section. This dashboard provides a detailed breakdown of Recovered and Lost subscriptions — key metrics reflecting the health of the anti-churn strategies. To build up recurring revenue in the long run, optimizing these metrics can be essential.

Additionally, merchants can now analyze the most common cancellation reasons and assess the effectiveness of Recovery steps.

To check the Retention Flow performance dashboard, go to Analytics > Retention Flow.

<Update label="2024-06-07" description="Upsells in subscriptions">
  ![Upsells](/assets/updates/2024-06-07/upsells.png)

Acquiring new customers is expensive, so maximizing Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) becomes essential for businesses with subscription models. CLV can be enhanced by improving retention, increasing delivery frequency, and boosting the Average Order Value (AOV). Among various strategies to increase AOV, upselling stands out as one of the most popular and effective.

This week, we launched a new feature in Juo to support merchants in increasing CLV — Upsells. This feature allows merchants to create dedicated upsell campaigns for their subscribers. Merchants can select which products to offer as upsells, add exclusive discounts available only to subscribers, and set a time limit on the offer to encourage prompt action. Upsell products will be visible in the customer portal where subscribers can conveniently add them to their upcoming orders.

Upsells are available on all plans. To create an upsell experience, navigate to > Experiences > Upsells.

**Improvements and fixes**

  </Update>

<Update label="2024-05-31" description="Email notifications log">
  ![Email notifications log](/assets/updates/2024-05-31/email-notifications-log.png)

Clear and transparent communication with subscribers is crucial for building strong retention. The foundation for this communication are transactional emails sent to subscribers and triggered by various events such as an upcoming renewal, a new order, or a failed payment.

To help merchants stay in sync with the notifications their subscribers receive, we are introducing an additional layer of information to the subscription timeline — the email notifications log. Starting from this week, merchants will be able to see exactly when an email notification was sent and delivered, and whether and when the customer opened the email and clicked the link. Soon, we will also add an option to manually trigger a resend notification. This will allow for more efficient customer support and, as a result, a better subscriber experience.

The email notifications log is part of the Subscription timeline.

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added a renewal check that prevents the renewal of subscriptions without a delivery method if they contain a product that requires shipping
- Added an option to include products in Curated Boxes for specific customer segments based on customer tags in the Merchant Portal

<Update label="2024-05-17" description="Cohort Retention">
  ![Cohort Retention](/assets/updates/2024-05-17/cohort-retention.png)

Healthy retention metrics are crucial for a subscription business. Regular analysis of retention and churn rates allows merchants to identify areas for improvement and plan effective strategies to improve these key indicators.

This week, we're introducing the Cohort Retention dashboard in the new Analytics section of Juo. This dashboard offers insights into customer retention performance and trends, allowing merchants to analyze the retention of customers who subscribed in a specific month.

Additionally, starting this week, merchants can find all of the metrics in the new section — Analytics. General metrics have been enriched with the number of Subscription Orders and AOV. Merchants can also view metrics with a breakdown for new subscription orders and recurring ones (renewals).

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added an option to use a different delivery profile for calculating shipping rates than the one used in checkout
- Added configurable message to shipping discount extension

Customer support teams rely on easy subscription management and detailed subscriber information to be able to quickly help customers with their queries.

This week, we're launching Subscription Timeline to help customer support representatives provide positive subscriber experience. The Timeline displays all events related to a specific subscription, including changes made by a customer or merchant, as well as automatic actions.

<Update label="2024-04-26" description="Build-a-box analytics">
  ![Build-a-box analytics](/assets/updates/2024-04-26/box-analytics.png)

Good performance of a subscription offer depends on regular data analysis and continuous iterations. In recent weeks, we've enhanced our analytics dashboard and added new layers to help merchants understand and boost the effectiveness of their offers. This week, we're going further to expand Juo's analytics and provide more data points for our merchants with Build-a-box analytics.

This new dashboard provides insights on Build-a-box offer performance, including top information like: Revenue, Number of orders and Average order value. These metrics are further divided by purchase type: One-time, Subscription first order, and Subscription recurring. Merchants can also analyze which products are most frequently purchased in the box. Product data points include: Total quantity sold, Average quantity per order, Total recurring revenue, and Total revenue.

The Build-a-box report can be found in the bottom section of the main Dashboard.

**Improvements and fixes**

<Update label="2024-04-19" description="Custom product properties">
  ![Product properties](/assets/updates/2024-04-19/product-properties.png)

To make subscription offers more attractive, DTC brands often adjust and personalize products for each subscriber. By giving customers a range of customizations, merchants face the challenge of tracking all those selected options and making fulfillment easy. Additional information can be recorded in the form of custom properties that are saved separately for each subscription and facilitate product selection for each customer.

This week, following requests from our merchants, we added support to define and manage custom product properties in individual subscriptions. This feature allows merchants to collect, view, and edit additional, subscription-specific information about a given SKU and use it to personalize subscriptions. It effectively lets subscribers receive customized products.

Custom properties can be managed in a subscription view by updating a selected product. Information added as a custom property will automatically be added to all upcoming subscription orders.

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added an option to add a free product to new intentional subscriptions

- Improved the calculation of the next billing date when the original order has scheduled fulfillments. Now, the next billing date will always be after the last scheduled fulfillment, as opposed to the default Shopify behavior.

<Update label="2024-04-05" description="Product-level analytics">
  ![Products analytics](/assets/updates/2024-04-05/products-analytics.png)

This week, following requests from merchants, we added a new layer of data related to the performance of products sold in subscription.

To optimize the subscription experience, merchants often want to analyze which products are most often subscribed, which have the best retention, and which bring in the most revenue. Also, to ensure product availability for subscribers, merchants plan inventory in accordance with subscription renewals.

Merchants can find the report presenting key product-related information on the main dashboard. The available metrics show which products sell best on subscription, their Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), and the total revenue from the subscription of a particular SKU. And the aforementioned information about the number of subscriptions with a given product renewing in the next 7 and 30 days is also provided. This allows for inventory planning and ensures that subscribers receive their products on time.

Product-level analytics is available for clients on all plans.

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added a configurable dunning flow period
- Added German translation of the Customer Portal
- Added a breakdown of subscriptions to the subscribers list page in the Merchant Portal

  </Update>

<Update label="2024-03-29" description="Subscribers analytics and multi-property search">
  ![Subscribers analytics](/assets/updates/2024-03-29/subscribers-analytics.png)

This week, we've been working on enhancing analytics by adding new metrics and refreshing charts for better visibility and clarity.

Understanding the metrics behind the subscriber base is crucial for improving retention and growing recurring revenue. From today in Juo, merchants have access to data points at the subscriber level. The information available to merchants includes the number of subscribers divided by status: active, paused, cancelled, expired, failed. Additionally, merchants can see a comparison against the previous period, as well as how the numbers have changed over the last 30 days. The line charts on the subscribers view are powered by our new metric endpoints.

Additionally, multi-property search and filtering options have been added to the subscribers dashboard. Merchants can now easily search for subscribers by: id, email, first name, last name, or phone number.

On top of the additional metrics, the line charts on the dashboard have been refreshed. Merchants can now also compare the previous period for the recurring revenue, retention, and active subscriptions line charts.

**Improvements and fixes**

<Update label="2024-03-22" description="New workflow rule: Send email">
  ![Workflow rule: Send email](/assets/updates/2024-03-22/send-emails.gif)

We are always seeking ways to increase flexibility and improve the efficiency of custom subscription workflows. Therefore, this week we are giving merchants a new powerful feature — the ability to send emails as rules in Cycles.

But that's not all. The template editing itself has received some UX and QoL improvements. Email messages can be written in plain text or include HTML tags. Additionally, messages can include Liquid variables, tags, or filters which can be used for dynamic content like the `customer.first_name` or `store.name`. All this with autocomplete to make composing fast and easy.

Emails in workflows are enabled for all users by default and can be set up under Subscription Experiences ‣ Custom Workflows.

<Update label="2024-03-15" description="Renewal flows">
  ![Renewal flows](/assets/updates/2024-03-15/renewal-flows.png)

Over the past few weeks, we've been working on new components for subscription renewal flows.

Every subscriber is unique, and the sequences responsible for renewing their subscription orders should reflect and adapt to this. Our building blocks allow for the creation of custom series of renewal actions using preferred communication channels. Merchants can use SMS or emails (DMs coming soon) and schedule custom sending times (specific days or hours), also in relation to the original subscription purchase timestamp. Messaging in the new retention flows can be customized freely and also A/B tested, in order to maximize those flows that yield the best results in retention. This is particularly important for A2A-based, intentional subscriptions.

The new retention flow engine is currently in beta, available for selected merchants.

  ![Editable tags](/assets/updates/2024-02-23/editable-tags.gif)

Tags are an essential tool for identifying, filtering, or segmenting specific orders and customers. They enable managers or data analysts to execute bulk actions on subscription-related entries. Each new subscription order and subscriber is automatically labeled by Juo with customer- and order-related tags. Merchants now have the ability to modify these tag labels to suit their individual needs. Edited tags can always be reset to their default state. Once the tag labels are updated, the changes will automatically be applied to all new orders and customers.

Soon we will give merchants the ability to create custom tags and overwrite labels retrospectively. To edit tag labels, go to > Settings > General > Tags setup.

<Update label="2024-02-16" description="Introducing Curated Boxes">
  ![Curated Boxes](/assets/updates/2024-02-16/curated-boxes.png)

Curated subscriptions have become a popular business strategy for many DTC brands. This trend is widely adopted by those who are willing to offer curated selections tailored to the unique tastes and preferences of their customers. However, navigating the complexities of this strategy in subscription requires a balance between customer personalization and smooth business operations.

Adding Curated Boxes to the box management in the app was specifically requested by store owners whose subscription tactics' effectiveness depends on accurate stock planning and scheduling billing dates.

The main goal of variable boxes was to enable merchants **to build a queue of predefined subscription boxes with different sets of SKUs**. Box contents can be based on merchants' specific subscription tactics and/or adjusted to their stock. Not to mention, this can depend on seasonal promotions or general trends among customers.

Merchants can plan specific fulfillment dates for each customized box. Shipment in Curated Boxes operates in 2 modes: shipment on a specific day (e.g., always on the 10th working day of each month) or, as it works in subscribe-and-save, on the day of subscription purchase (more precisely, the day of creating the Shopify contract).

Similarly, merchants can use one of two ways of scheduling billing: first, based on the date when the subscription contract was created (again, as it works in subscribe-and-save), and second, a variable date related to the shipping date (e.g., a few days before shipping).

Juo users can build and schedule up to 12 boxes in advance, set and edit their names as they like (names are not visible to subscribers), and will soon be able to preview the stock levels for each product both during the editing of the box and after its completion.

Soon, we will add the ability to show subscribers the contents of queued boxes. For now, all curated boxes work as mystery boxes, and their contents are not visible to customers.

To build your first queue of customized boxes, go to Experiences > Curated Boxes.

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added an option to hide the subscription widget when the variant is not available in the Shopify theme editor
- Added an option to set up Curated Boxes on the Subscription Experiences page in the Merchant Portal
- Added Curated Boxes support, with products automatically added to scheduled orders and keeping fulfillments in sync with Curated Boxes' subscription plans
- Added support for refunding orders with transactions processed by alternative payment methods
- Changed the order cancellation behavior when the order is not paid in time to not suppress notifications by default
- Fixed a rounding issue in which the subscription total could differ by 0.01 from the expected amount
- Fixed an issue in which a duplicate order could be placed after a subscription was renewed using an alternative payment method if an error occurred immediately after the order was placed
- Fixed an issue in which an order might not be placed after a subscription was renewed by using an alternative payment method
- Fixed an issue in which payment method webhooks were attempting to synchronize payment methods of customers who are not subscribers
- Fixed an issue in which removing a product from the box was not possible when the subscription frequency had been changed previously in the Merchant Portal
- Fixed an issue in which subscription creation was further delayed after an order with subscription intent was paid with a delay

<Update label="2024-02-02" description="Subscription Extras">
  ![Subscription extras](/assets/updates/2024-02-02/subscription-extras.png)

Converting new customers to subscribers and successfully retaining them are pivotal for most subscription-first merchants. Wanting to build lasting relationships with their subscribers, merchants need to continuously look for new ways to surprise, delight, and retain customers for the long term.

Today, we’re launching **Extras** to make it possible for merchants to elevate their current subscribers’ experience with additional perks and retain them more effectively. This merchant-requested feature makes it possible to boost the subscribers’ experience by offering additional price drops, free products, or no-cost shipping offered on top of the existing subscription discounts and benefits.

With add-ons, merchants can choose one or more additional benefits and have them added to any subscription cycle or cycles within an existing subscription plan. The extras will then be automatically added to all subscription orders that meet the selection criteria. This gives merchants an effective tool to reward their subscribers in bulk, without having to set up rewards for each subscriber or subscription individually.

Extras are enabled for all Juo merchants by default and can be set up under > Experiences > Subscribe and Save > Subscription plans.

**Improvements and fixes**

- Fixed an issue in which updating one-time products could lead to converting them to recurring products
- Fixed an issue in which some subscriptions were accidentally processed one cycle too early
- Fixed an issue in which the membership tag was verified indefinitely after being assigned correctly to a customer

<Update label="2024-01-26" description="Enhanced Klaviyo Integration">
  ![Enhanced Klaviyo integration](/assets/updates/2024-01-26/enhanced-klaviyo-integration.png)

To keep their retention rates high, subscription merchants may have to deal with two types of churn: voluntary and involuntary. Voluntary churn happens when subscribers cancel their subscription deliberately and knowingly, while involuntary churn results from issues subscribers are often not aware of, such as lacking funds in their cards, having an expired credit card, or accidentally exceeding their CC limit.

So far, thanks to [Juo - Klaviyo integration](https://juo.io/guides/klaviyo-integration), merchants could send targeted communication around key drivers of voluntary churn, such as purchases and upcoming renewals. Today, we’re expanding the existing Klaviyo integration service to also include billing and inventory-related metrics that will help merchants target and reduce involuntary churn specifically.

Starting from today, merchants will be able to inform their subscribers about the status of the payments (payment successful, payment failed, payment requires action), and out of stock items in their subscriptions. While informing, they will also be able to prompt their subscribers to provide input needed to resolve the payment and OOS issues and so, to keep their subscriptions active.

So, when a recurring payment fails because the subscriber’s CC has expired, merchants can now send an automatic email notification that will inform the subscriber about the CC issue and ask them to update their payment details.

The additional events will send automatically starting from today and will be available for all merchants on the Standard and Pro plans who have enabled Klaviyo integration. The new metrics will start appearing in Klaviyo as soon as a corresponding event occurs for a given subscriber.

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added new metrics to Klaviyo integration: `Billed Subscription`, `Billing Failed Subscription`, `Billing Requires Action Subscription` and `Product Out Of Stock Subscription`
- Added an option to close the onboarding with some steps unfinished

- Fixed an issue in which the “Learn More" button was misaligned on the Subscription Experiences page in the Merchant Portal
- Fixed an issue in which subscription updates could not be processed after revoking a payment

<Update label="2024-01-19" description="BLIK subscriptions">
  ![BLIK subscriptions](/assets/updates/2024-01-19/BLIK-subscriptions.png)

Customers have high expectations when it comes to making purchases. They want customized payment journeys that keep their data safe, while also being as frictionless and fast as possible. And when it comes to recurring payments, the standards and expectations are even higher. In short, subscribers expect nothing less than perfection.

To stay competitive, any merchant that accepts recurring payments should start with understanding the payment methods that their subscribers prefer. But payment experiences happen in a diverse global landscape that defies one-size-fits-all solutions. These preferences change with each generation. That makes the payment landscape in every market unique.

Now, especially Shopify merchants in Europe have a very limited range of options to offer when it comes to subscription payment methods. For us, as an EU-based startup, it is particularly important to provide ecommerce businesses with PSD3 compliant, A2A, open banking-enabled subscription payments (VRPs in the UK or DRPs in continental Europe).

Today we officially take the first step in that mission by offering an A2A-based subscription payment experience for merchants in Poland, which enables their customers to pay for subscriptions with BLIK — the most popular Polish payment method. BLIK dominates the Polish ecommerce market with almost a 70% share. If you don't give Polish customers the ability to pay with BLIK, you practically accept a critical decrease in conversion rates and significantly lower customer experience.

BLIK for subscriptions (in Polish: Subskrypcje BLIKIEM

) for Shopify is in a limited, invite-only private beta. If you'd like to join, please visit the [Juo website and schedule a demo](https://juo.io/demo).

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added an option to apply Tiered discounts separately to each cart line item
- Added a coming soon Curated boxes experience to the Subscription Experiences page in the Merchant Portal

<Update label="2024-01-05" description="Platform-independent">
  ![Platform-independent](/assets/updates/2024-01-05/platform-independent.png)

New year, new week, new product heights. Today, we announce the launch of the beta version of the Juo Subscription Platform. It's new, it's powerful, and it's free from ecommerce platform constraints.

It’s always been our goal to go beyond Shopify and build a subscription enablement that also works with other popular ecommerce platforms, both globally (like WooCommerce) and locally (like IdoSell). This week, we took a huge step towards making it possible.

Here are some of the high-level concepts behind the change. First of all, our technology should support the concept of what we call intentional subscriptions. This means ultimate flexibility and freedom of choice for both merchants and their customers (subscribers). Secondly, as an EU-based company, we want to fully enable local payment methods, especially A2A recurring for subscriptions (Open banking ready and PSD3 compliant). We started by streamlining our subscription renewal process to support additional payment methods beyond those supported by Shopify, such as BLIK, iDEAL, and SEPA.

And finally, we don't want to be dependent on Shopify, both tech- and business-wise. We think Shopify is great, but when it comes to subscriptions, it has its limitations. Currently, the majority of our application's functionality is already independent of Shopify. Ultimately, the Juo Subscriptions app will simply be an integration with the main platform.

All in all, the platform now provides us (and ultimately merchants) with everything that's needed for the subscription life cycle (new payment methods, subscription renewal improvements, and intentional subscriptions).

On a more granular level, along with the launch of our platform beta, we have made the following process improvements:

- Added new data structures to store information on subscriptions, products, and discounts
- Implemented two-way sync between Juo and Shopify to ensure that the data is always up to date on both platforms
- Enhanced the process of renewing subscriptions to make it more reliable, fast, and flexible
- Added new extension blocks that enable additional payment methods directly on Shopify Checkout
- Added new payment method: BLIK for subscriptions
- Added new payment method: SEPA Direct Debit
- Integrated with Mollie for SEPA Direct Debit
- Integrated with Przelewy24 for BLIK

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added support for SEPA Direct Debit payment method
- Added a visual feedback that payment is waiting to be processed
- Added an option to create subscriptions without a payment method
- Added extra safety check to prevent more than one active renewal processes at the same time
- Added safety check to renewal process that ensures there are no pending billing attempts
- Improved the performance of "Renew now" action on a subscription
- Fixed an issue in which "Skip" button was not working properly on subscriptions listing page in the Customer Portal
- Fixed an issue in which an expired discount could reappear on a subscription
- Fixed an issue in which no available shipping methods were presented in the Customer Portal
- Fixed an issue in which subscription panel might not be present on a checkout thank you page / order status page
- Fixed an issue in which subscription status could not be updated after processing a billing attempt
- Fixed an issue in which subscription was failing to load due to an archived order in the Customer Portal
- Fixed an issue in which update credit card was not possible in the Customer Portal
  </Update>

<Update label="2023-12-29" description="Improvements and Fixes">
  - Added an empty state to subscription list in the Customer Portal - Added the
  "Experiences" page which allows discovery and setup of major app features in

</Update>

<Update label="2023-12-22" description="Redeem discounts in Customer Portal">
  ![Redeem discounts](/assets/updates/2023-12-22/redeem-discounts.png)

Merchants selling subscriptions via Juo can apply a variety of incentives to entice and reward their customers: free gifts, loyalty bonuses, progressive discounts, quantity discounts, and since recently — combined discounts.

To keep the appeal of these incentives fresh and make sure that they won’t go unnoticed, we’re now also adding support for one-time, subscription-specific discounts as a way for merchants to boost their subscriber retention, increase LTV, and decrease the likelihood of churn.

Starting from this week, merchants can create and share additional subscription discount codes (for percentage-based, fixed amount, free shipping, product, and order discounts) with their subscribers and let them redeem the discounts directly in the Customer Portal. This means merchants can now use one-time, seasonal discounts to not only attract new customers but also as a powerful subscriber retention booster.

The additional discount codes will be added one-time on top of the existing, automatic discounts and loyalty benefits that are already applied to subscriptions. They can be activated in Settings > Customer Portal > Manage options. Simply check **Redeem discount code** to enable.

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added the "Redeem discount code" option to the Customer Portal management settings in the Merchant Portal
- Added the ability to apply a discount using a discount code to an ongoing subscription in the Customer Portal
- Fixed an issue in which some subscriptions could not be indexed properly due to too long notes
- Fixed an issue in which subscription plan name inputs might show different names than the ones in the Merchant Portal
- Fixed an issue in which the minimum billing cycles value was duplicated from an existing plan when editing selling plans in the Merchant Portal
  </Update>

<Update label="2023-12-15" description="Combined discounts">
  ![Combined discounts](/assets/updates/2023-12-15/combined-discounts.png)

Offering additional discounts is among the most popular and effective conversion tactics merchants can use. Subscribe and save offers, subscription boxes, starter packs, or SKU swaps usually come with extra discounts that help to turn more potential customers into subscribers. Especially in the holiday season, merchants may need to flexibly combine some discounts, while excluding others, to tap their full subscription potential.

This week, we’re adding discount combinations for merchants who’d like to have more control over the incentives they want to offer along with their products. Using Combined discounts, merchants can choose which types of discounts will be stackable for one-time, subscription, and subscription box orders. This means they can simultaneously and automatically apply, e.g., box, product, and shipping discounts to eligible orders, while also giving their customers the ability to enter additional discount codes manually at checkout.

Alternatively, merchants can also choose to not apply certain additional discounts to their subscribe and save and subscription box orders, gaining full control over the savings they want to enable for their subscribers.

Combined discounts are available for all Juo merchants starting from this week and can be set up under Build-a-box and Tiered discounts, respectively.

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added the possibility to set minimum box item count for free gifts when ordering Build-a-box
- Added an option to combine Build-a-box discount with other discounts
- Added an option to combine the Tiered discount with other discounts
- Added `subscription` tag to all subscription orders
- Added a custom `Detected Subscription Intent` metric sent to Klaviyo when subscription intent has been detected
- Improved the average subscription duration calculation method in the Dashboard
- Fixed an issue in which it was not possible to update Build-a-box subscriptions if there were more than 10 selling plans set up in the Merchant Portal
  </Update>

<Update label="2023-12-08" description="Starter packs">
  ![Starter packs](/assets/updates/2023-12-08/starter-packs.png)

Subscription experiences that convert customers into subscribers start with creating a high perceived value from the very first order. Merchants who want to capitalize on their customers’ subscription intent and turn them into subscribers more effectively are looking for new ways to provide extra perks to their subscribers, especially at the onset of their journey.

Today, we’re adding a new type of workflow that enables merchants to create starter pack / refill subscriptions and turn more of their customers into subscribers with an enticing first order.

Using Starter packs, merchants can set up a sequence of orders that will include a starter pack (containing a special product or set of products), followed by refill (or replenishment) orders, available in subscription. The prices for the Starter pack and refills can either depend on the products that are included or be averaged for the entire subscription.

As opposed to regular Juo’s dynamic boxes with fixed SKUs, Starter packs give customers the ability to manage their subscriptions after the first, welcome order. Meaning, they can swap, remove or add products, adjust order frequency, or reschedule upcoming deliveries as they would with any subscriptions. This allows for more flexibility and helps not only convert, but also retain existing subscribers for longer.

Starter packs are available for all Juo merchants and can be set up under Dynamic boxes. (To create a Starter pack, make sure that “Fulfill parent product automatically” is checked off and the “Continue subscription with products from the final step” is selected).

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added a tooltip to padlock that shows fixed fulfillment day for subscriptions and updated its appearance in the Customer Portal
- Improved updating products in subscription boxes to automatically re-apply product discounts in the Merchant Portal
- Fixed an issue in which fixed fulfillment day tooltip displayed incorrect message for weekday fulfillments in the Customer Portal
- Fixed an issue in which it was not possible to change subscription frequency when fixed fulfillment day was set in the Customer Portal
- Fixed an issue in which the `shop/redact` request webhook handler failed due to incorrect input schema
- Fixed an issue in which orders from delayed renewals (due to billing failures or out-of-stock items), had their fulfillment pushed to the next fulfillment window when fixed fulfillment day was set for a subscription plan
- Fixed an issue that caused renewals of migrated subscriptions to fail if subscriptions had failed billing attempts prior to migration
- Fixed an issue in which editing products in a box resulted in duplicated discounts
  </Update>

<Update label="2023-12-01" description="Subscription intent">
  ![Subscription intent](/assets/updates/2023-12-01/subscription-intent.png)

We believe in the great potential of unlocking subscription intent. Understanding the buying patterns and behaviors of returning customers is key to converting them into loyal subscribers and building sustainable retention. However, to create highly personalized experiences, merchants first need to identify the right customer segments.

So this week we're introducing subscription intent detection. Juo's smart algorithm scans the order base to identify and tag customers likely to become subscribers. If a customer has purchased the same (or similar) product multiple times, this feature allows merchants to tag this customer as a potential subscriber and create a specific segment based on the tag. This means, merchants can then launch contextual campaigns, incentivizing these loyal customers to convert their purchases into a subscription.

Also, by creating subscription intent segments in Shopify or Klaviyo, merchants can now send all kinds of highly personalized marketing campaigns. Customer data points available for reference include: average purchase frequency, purchased product SKUs, and product variants.

Subscription intent detection is a PRO feature, but for a limited time, it will be available to all Juo customers.

Merchants can enable it under Settings > Retention and acquisition > Subscription intent.

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added an option to disable automatic fulfillment of parent products in orders containing Dynamic boxes
- Added an option to remove parent products from Dynamic boxes after a set number of cycles
- Added information about remaining fulfillments for prepaid orders to the Subscription details view in the Customer Portal

<Update label="2023-11-17" description="Moonshot.store take-off">
  ![Moonshot.store take-off](/assets/updates/2023-11-17/moonshot-store-take-off.png)

In order to work as effective recurring revenue drivers, subscription experiences need to be tailored to specific stores and specific audiences. Being one of the most feature-rich subscription apps on the market, Juo gives merchants virtually endless possibilities as to the type, range, and complexity of the subscription experiences they can create.

We’re launching [Moonshot Store](https://moonshot.store) (a.k.a. Juo demo store) to give merchants a better idea of how these different subscription experiences can work and behave when implemented, as well as give them the possibility to test them live on an actual, working store.

Using the Moonshot’s extraterrestrial inventory and setup as a substitute for their own, merchants can navigate between the available products, learn more about subscription offers, and proceed to checkout, having relevant discounts and benefits applied. For example, they can add different products to their cart in subscription, or add products one-time and then subscribe the entire cart. They can create their own [subscription boxes](https://moonshot.store/products/build-your-moonshot-box), and [multi-variant boxes](https://moonshot.store/products/multi-variant-box), and see how the [Box Booster’s](https://moonshot.store/cart/clear?return_to=/cart/add?items[][id]=41988316889271%26items[][quantity]=1%26return_to=/products/mercury-drops?variant=41988316889271) incentives work. Or, they can learn about the [Moonshot membership program](https://moonshot.store/pages/moonshot-club-membership) or [Moonshot subscription program](https://moonshot.store/pages/about-subscriptions) through a dedicated landing page.

Apart from live-previewing and testing the features, Moonshot also intends to serve as an inspiration for merchants who are already selling subscriptions or want to launch a subscription program in their stores, providing ideas, examples, and guidance for their own implementation.

Moonshot is now available from the [Juo Subscriptions listing page](https://apps.shopify.com/juo-subscriptions) on the Shopify App Store and will be expanded with new experiences in line with new Juo features.

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added lazy loading to the onboarding video in the Merchant Portal
- Fixed an issue where it was impossible to remove a product with a one-time discount that had expired
- Fixed an issue in which UVPs were not editable in the subscription widget
- Fixed an issue in which it was not possible to select one of the available billing plans in the Merchant Portal
- Fixed an issue where a dialog informing that a feature is not available on the current plan was not dismissed when navigating to another page in the Merchant Portal
- Fixed an issue in which the `/exitiframe` page was not working correctly in the Merchant Portal
  </Update>

<Update label="2023-11-10" description="New pricing including Pro plan">
  ![New pricing including Pro plan](/assets/updates/2023-11-10/new-pricing-including-pro-plan.png)

After the official Juo launch on Shopify App Store, new merchants have been able to self-onboard and self-serve under one-fits-all, early adopter pricing. Since then, we’ve started launching limited-access Pro features, aimed at subscription-savvy merchants who want to create advanced subscription experiences, like dynamic product swapping, contextual upsells to subscriptions, or personalized notifications with total flexibility and automation.

Following these new additions, we’re now launching a Pro pricing plan that contains all the recently launched advanced features, as well as additional retention, AOV boosting, and analytics tools, aimed at subscription-first merchants. Launching or upgrading to the Pro plan, they can further optimize and customize their current subscription offering with advanced workflows using personalized SMS notifications, intro and replenishment offers, or conditional, dynamic product swapping.

Alongside the Pro plan, we’re now offering the Standard plan which contains out-of-the-box, customizable subscription widgets and easy-to-set-up subscription enablers that can be launched within minutes without any extra assistance.

The two pricing plans are now available both in the Shopify App Store and in the app, so merchants getting started with Juo or looking to upgrade their current plan, can easily test / preview the available subscription features and switch to a higher plan once their subscription needs grow.

The current plan can be viewed and managed in the Settings tab, under Manage billing plan.

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added an option to enable/disable Dynamic boxes in the Merchant Portal
- Added a billing plan selection step to the installation flow in the Merchant Portal
- Added an option to manage the billing plan on the settings page in the Merchant Portal

- Fixed an issue in which out of stock notification email was sometimes not sent
- Fixed an issue in which pausing a subscription didn't work for contracts with fixed delivery dates
- Fixed an issue in which the billing cycle limit was defaulting to "1" when adding a new selling plan in the Merchant Portal
- Fixed an issue in which the subscriptions breakdown panel on the dashboard displayed zeros due to an invalid date range in the Merchant Portal
  </Update>

<Update label="2023-11-03" description="New feature: Billing cycles limit">
  ![Billing cycles limit](/assets/updates/2023-11-03/billing-cycles-limit.png)

Both prepaid subscriptions and subscription gifts can help merchants boost their new subscriber acquisition while significantly reducing CAC, especially in the holiday season.

We’re launching Billing cycles limit to help merchants combine their prepaids, custom boxes, and dynamic boxes with fixed-length subscriptions that will automatically stop after a set number of renewals. This means more effective subscriber acquisition for merchants and better experience for the customers who are looking for giftboxes or time-limited prepaids. Instead of subscribing indefinitely upfront, these customers can now choose to only pay for a number of orders in a subscription they want to give as a gift and have that subscription automatically put on hold after the renewal limit has been reached.

Soon, it will also be able for merchants to let customers reactivate their existing prepaid subscriptions or boxes after they’ve been put on hold, by giving them an option to either prolong the subscription for another period or even subscribe indefinitely.

The feature is available for all merchants by default and can be set up under Subscribe & save \> Selling plans \> Additional options on both the regular and Pro plans.

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added next billing date calculation based on `Shipment Week` cart attribute to subscription contracts for the first subscription renewal
- Added notification messages for subscriptions with Billing cycles limit set up in the Customer Portal
- Added Billing cycles limit information to the Subscription details page in the Merchant Portal
- Added the ability to set up Billing cycles limit when creating a subscription plan in the Merchant Portal

- Fixed an issue in which incorrect prices were shown when editing boxes in the Customer Portal
  </Update>

<Update label="2023-10-27" description="Improvements and fixes">

<Update label="2023-10-20" description="Multi-variant box management">
  ![Multi-variant box management](/assets/updates/2023-10-20/multi-variant-box-management.png)

Subscription contracts with multiple items, such as custom or curated boxes, may be more difficult for merchants to retain, if not backed up by flexible management. Letting subscribers create and adjust their existing box orders with ease is known to facilitate both new customer acquisition and current subscriber retention.

With today’s update, we enable multi-variant support for managing custom and curated boxes. This customer-requested feature makes it possible for merchants to provide an even more flexible box building and management experience to their customers on the product page storefront and in the Customer Portal. Thanks to enhanced inventory management support, customers building their custom boxes can now add two or more variants of the same product to the box and receive volume discounts based on the number of variants added.

What is more, customers who have already purchased their custom boxes will now also be able to exchange their content with no obstacles, switching to different products or variants even more flexibly in the Customer Portal. This means not only easy swapping from one variant to another, but also adding and keeping multiple variants in an existing single-variant box.

Multi-variant box management will be available in Juo starting from this week and will be enabled by default for all merchants who offer custom boxes in their stores.

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added a Checkout UI block containing subscription details to add to the Thank you pages
- Added sorting for Build-a-box tier discounts in the API response
- Added an "Edit" link to the tier discounts list in the Build-a-box settings panel

- Fixed an issue with broken product links in the products table in the Merchant Portal
- Fixed an issue in which the Merchant Portal failed to load for custom apps

<Update label="2023-10-13" description="TYP/OSP extension for subscription orders">
  ![TYP/OSP extension](/assets/updates/2023-10-13/typ-osp-extension.png)

Shopify’s [Checkout Extensibility](https://shopify.dev/apps/checkout/thank-you-order-status) will be expanding this month, letting merchants customize Thank you and Order status pages on top of Checkout and Shop Pay with dedicated apps and extensions. For subscription merchants, this presents another opportunity to simplify subscription management for the existing subscribers, increase AOV, and even convert one-time purchases to subscriptions.

Leveraging the Checkout UI Extension and Shopify Functions, we’re now making it possible for merchants to display additional subscription information on their Thank you and Order status pages, post-purchase. All subscription orders will now feature a list of subscription products ordered with their quantities, along with delivery frequencies, billing date, and the next scheduled renewal. On top of that, subscribers will also be able to switch to managing their subscriptions easily from the Thank you and Order status page, using the Manage subscription button in the subscription summary section.

Soon, it will also be possible to display related products and let customers upsell to subscription from the TYP/OSP pages. The additional subscription details and the upsell functionality will be available for both Standard and Plus merchants once Shopify makes the extensions officially available.

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added an option to add multiple variants of the same product to Build-a-box subscriptions in the Customer Portal
- Added an option to edit multiple variants of the same product to Build-a-box subscriptions in the Customer Portal
- Added notification for the maximum discount threshold when editing Build-a-box subscriptions in the Customer Portal
- Added `change` event trigger for selling plan changes in the subscription widget
- Updated subscription renewal process to no longer interrupt when Klaviyo integration is not set up correctly

- Fixed an issue in which exporting subscriptions failed due to incorrect pricing policy validation schema
- Fixed an issue in which some Subscription page translations were not visible in the Customer Portal
  </Update>

<Update label="2023-10-06" description="Juo Docs">
  ![Juo Docs](/assets/updates/2023-10-06/juo-docs.png)

Feature-rich subscription apps offer more value and sustainability with a much better initial experience if they’re accompanied by suitable documentation. Merchants who onboard into a new subscription platform are able to use the documentation to set up their subscription offers on the spot, without too extensive external support.

Following the official Juo launch on the Shopify App Store, we’re now launching [Juo Docs](https://juo.io) to encourage new merchants in Juo to self-serve and take full ownership of their subscription setup, from storefront integration, through customizations, to (re-)launching and managing their subscription plans.

The Docs feature a series of how-to guides that make the onboarding process easier for new merchants and ensure they can have their subscription plans set up to their preferences within minutes. Merchants getting started with subscriptions can also reference the guides to better understand what kinds of subscriptions they can offer in their stores with Juo. Or, they can also check out Juo’s subscription glossary and get familiar with subscription-related concepts, their meanings, and practical applications for their stores.

Tech-wise, we built a custom solution which checks all the boxes for us. We use [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) as a headless CMS for content creation and management, [Astro](https://astro.build/) for static rendering of the pages, and [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/) for static search. As with the app, we like to take care of all the details ourselves.

Soon, the Docs will also include developers’ documentation, including the API, so that more complex / custom integrations and implementations for larger stores can also be handled on the merchants’ side. The Docs will also be expanded to cover the most recent and upcoming features in the app.

**Improvements and fixes**

<Update label="2023-09-22" description="Activity log">
  ![Activity log](/assets/updates/2023-09-22/activity-log.png)

Running a subscription-first business requires merchants to keep track of the ongoing subscription activity in their stores — from new purchases and renewals, through payment and order processing, to changes and reschedules made by subscribers. Juggling multiple subscription contracts and subscriber adjustments calls for a real-time, organized record of all subscription events.

This week, we’re launching Activity log to give merchants full visibility into their subscription usage and billing activity in a separate view, without the need to work across multiple subscription offers and contracts independently.

Using the log, merchants can get a quick, real-time overview of all subscription-related events in their stores, such as purchase, renewal, payment, order reschedule, item change, or any other modification. They can also zoom in on a specific event and find out the exact date and time, the trigger, and all the details of what exactly was modified.

Currently, merchants can use a date filter to narrow down to a specific day or days they want to look at more closely. Soon, they’ll also be able to filter and export log data to find and analyze the behaviors of individual subscribers and the performance of their selling plans as a whole.

Activity log is enabled for all merchants by default. It can be accessed from the app menu or through a link in the Recent activity section on the Dashboard.

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added a new setting to Box Booster that expands or collapses the widget by default
- Added an option to set fixed fulfillment day for a day of the week in the Merchant Portal

<Update label="2023-09-15" description="Adding SMS notifications">
  ![SMS notifications](/assets/updates/2023-09-15/sms-notifications.png)

Building subscriber loyalty and engagement depends on regular and ongoing communication between the brand and its audience. Merchants who want to develop closer relationships with their existing subscribers, as well as attract new ones, are more likely to prioritize direct and personal communication channels, like text notifications, or social media.

We’re adding SMS notifications as a new communication channel that allows merchants to reach their subscribers directly with more targeted, point-in-time messaging. Using SMS notifications, merchants can schedule their subscription renewal messages to send out automatically to subscribers at key steps in their subscription journey. Sent at the right moment, these messages increase engagement and management ease, especially for loyal, long-term subscribers.

To account for various subscription offers and subscriber audiences, each merchant can flexibly adjust the content of their notifications. They can also use smart Juo shortcodes to dynamically tailor parts of the message, like time to renewal or login link, to individual subscribers. Subscribers following the link will be able to make last-minute changes in their subscriptions conveniently, without switching context.

SMS notifications are currently a PRO feature that is enabled on request. Early adopters and merchants on the PRO pricing plan can request access and set up the notifications under Settings > Notifications > SMS.

<Update label="2023-09-08" description="New feature: Fixed fulfillment day">
  ![Fixed fulfillment day](/assets/updates/2023-09-08/fixed-fulfillment-day.png)

As subscriptions become more widespread in ecom, so do next-gen subscription models, like boxes or memberships. Unlike basic subscriptions, which can be billed and sent to each customer on the spot, boxes and memberships are more easily managed and provide a better subscriber experience if they’re sent or enabled on a fixed schedule.

Our new feature, Fixed fulfillment, helps merchants streamline their order fulfillment for better inventory and subscriber experience management. Using this new feature, merchants can set up their boxes, memberships, and traditional subscriptions to be billed and fulfilled always on the same day of the month, so they can handle all the shipments simultaneously.

In order to synchronize inventory restocks with shipments, merchants can also add a buffer period before the planned fulfillment day. Orders placed within the buffer period will be rescheduled to a later date. They can also set separate treatment of the first orders in a subscription — and send them as they come, or wait for the next scheduled fulfillment day. These two options ensure they’ll have enough time to always process the order before the planned fulfillment and that their customers won’t double order on their subscription.

Fixed fulfillment can be set individually for each subscription plan, so different frequencies or different types of subscriptions can be scheduled for different days of the month, giving merchants more control over their inventory flow.

To set up Fixed fulfillment, go to Selling plans > Advanced settings > Fixed fulfillment day.

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added the possibility to change the placement of the Box Booster notification on screen

<Update label="2023-08-25" description="Introducing Build-a-box Booster">
  ![Box Booster](/assets/updates/2023-08-25/box-booster.png)

Subscription boxes have taken ecommerce by storm as a fun and fresh way for customers to pick and subscribe to their favorite products. Variety and convenience, as well as cost savings these boxes provide make them very effective in increasing AOV and LTV for the brands offering them in their stores.

Yet, custom box builders are still a new thing, so they’re not free from some shortcomings for both merchants and customers. E.g., to enable box building, merchants need to use a dedicated “Build your box” page that has to be added to their store theme. This page only allows customers to select from a limited subset of products and are not always discovered in their shopping journey. As a result, there are many customers who might be willing to buy a box, but end up not doing so.

We’re launching Box Booster today as an enhancement for Build-a-box. Box Booster provides an across-inventory, page-independent, convenient way for the customers to build their boxes while they’re browsing the store. Based on the Fogg Behavior Model, it follows the customer on a page and detects when they’ve added a box-eligible product to their order and are close to unlocking an additional incentive. It then displays a storefront-adjusted, clickable notification that prompts the customer to add more products to their current box and unlock an even bigger benefit. Basically, it lowers the effort required to perform the action and serves as a trigger.

Booster uses PerformanceObserver API to listen to cart changes and adjust the incentives to its content in real time. It also works with all Shopify themes, custom carts, or any 3rd party extensions.

Box Booster is enabled by adding a block in the Shopify theme customizer to the pages where merchants want it to appear. Incentive details, tiers, and eligible products can be set up in the Merchant Portal, under Build-a-box.

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added enriched product descriptions in the Customer Portal
- Enabled price adjustment settings for Dynamic Boxes in the Merchant Portal
- Enabled cycle completion settings for Dynamic Boxes in the Merchant Portal
- Fixed an issue in which the retention chart showed no data in the Merchant Portal

  </Update>

<Update label="2023-08-11" description="Customizable retention flow">
  ![Cancellation poll](/assets/updates/2023-08-11/cancellation-poll.png)

Letting subscribers churn with no attempts to retain them is a huge missed opportunity for merchants. Not trying to understand why they want to cancel their subscription in the first place is another. With customizable, multipurpose retention flow, merchants can not only retain subscribers more effectively, but also collect valuable information in the process. Not to mention, custom flows with targeted incentives will always lead to higher retention and LTV.

Today, we’re adding new customization features to the retention flow to help merchants combine insight gathering with increased subscriber retention. Thanks to flexible incentive awards and survey logic, merchants can now suggest their own reasons for cancellation and decide which specific incentive should follow each reason. For example, they can offer extra discounts if the price is the main concern, or prompt to stay longer in return for additional feedback.

Soon, merchants will also be able to encourage product swaps with personalized product recommendations or suggest subscription cycle adjustments instead of cancelling. The new retention flow is available under Settings > Cancellation flow in the Merchant Portal — just check **Cancellation poll** to enable.

**Improvements and fixes**

- Fixed an issue in which an error message was displayed on the dashboard in the Merchant Portal when there were no subscription contracts yet
- Fixed an issue in which pagination for subscriptions was not working properly when sorting by the next renewal date in the Merchant Portal
- Fixed the loading state of the dashboard metrics in the Merchant Portal

<Update label="2023-08-04" description="Multi-property smart search">
  ![Multi-property smart search](/assets/updates/2023-08-04/multi-property-smart-search.png)

Zooming in on a group of subscriptions with selected attributes and isolating individual subscriptions for updates is key to streamlined subscription management and customer support, especially for merchants with larger subscriber volumes. As their subscriber bases continue to grow, merchants can no longer handle subscription management effectively without some degree of automation.

With today’s update, we’re giving merchants the ability to find and update subscriptions based on any of their attributes, such as ID, customer name, or email and adjust these subscriptions to their current needs and strategies. With multi-column smart search, merchants can filter out any subscriptions by status or length to only focus on subscribers who have recently purchased, need to update their payment method, or whose subscription is about to renew — making it possible to edit subscription cycle and content details selectively for subscribers.

Introduction of AI into the ecom space has now opened the door for more robust and targeted subscription management. With AI support, Juo merchants will soon be able to collectively adjust groups of subscriptions with a single change, add, or replace command applied to subscriptions with selected tags, properties, or even products.

Currently, single edits are available for all merchants, with bulk editing to be announced next.

<Update label="2023-07-21" description="Klaviyo integration">
  ![Juo Klaviyo integration](/assets/updates/2023-07-21/juo-klaviyo-integration.png)

Running store-specific workflows, like dynamic boxes or replenishments, merchants also need targeted email flows that can trigger at key moments of subscriber journeys to boost recurring revenue, subscriber loyalty, and further reduce churn.

For targeted customer communication, Klaviyo is a go-to solution and so it was important for merchants to keep their subscriber communication under the same roof. Hence, Klaviyo integration has been the number one request since our official app launch in April.

Today, we introduce Juo \+ Klaviyo integration to allow merchants to set up their own custom email flows in Klaviyo, alongside and fully linked to their subscription workflows in Juo. Thanks to that, merchants can now target subscribers with custom email flows, based on subscription-specific events and attributes, such as the number and type of the products in a subscription, next renewal date, or subscription length.

What’s more, merchants can also combine Juo email templates with their Klaviyo flows to handle payment and inventory-specific cases that would be hard to set up in Klaviyo, such as dunning flows or handling out-of-stock items.

Klaviyo integration will be available for all merchants starting from this week and can be activated with your API key in the app Settings, under Integrations → Klaviyo.

<Update label="2023-07-14" description="Lossless migration CLI">
  ![Lossless migration](/assets/updates/2023-07-14/lossless-migration.png)

Onboarding new merchants who have offered subscriptions before is much more challenging than installing afresh. Each subscription contract in Shopify is linked to multiple other entities: products, subscribers, payment information, shipping details, subscription orders, etc. In other words, migrating from one platform to another is usually full of edge-cases and nuances.

Failing to migrate any part of the subscription ecosystem can lead to missed future orders, cancellations, or even losing current subscribers over the need to resubscribe or create a new customer account.

By our standards, there’s only one way to do it right: lossless migration. We’ve been working for some time on an auxiliary migration CLI, enabling 100% accurate, seamless migration of not only current, but also historical subscription data.

Currently, Juo makes it possible for merchants, no matter if they use Subscriptions API or not, to switch their subscription solution seamlessly, without losing any subscription contracts, or subscribers in the process.

With this week’s update, not only current but also legacy data, including subscription order history and key subscription events, will be transferred in migrations.

This means, new customers migrating to Juo will maintain their subscription order and data continuity, with Juo as a single source of truth as to how their subscriptions performed before and after migration. Subscribers will also see their past and present subscription information in the Customer Portal for smooth and uninterrupted (no action required) subscription experience.

<Update label="2023-07-07" description="Forecasts">
  ![Forecasts](/assets/updates/2023-07-07/forecasts.png)

Lately we added Subscription Analytics to help merchants get insight into how their subscriptions have performed to date. Today, we’re adding Forecasts to let them look into the future of their subscription performance and adjust their inventory strategies in advance.

Forecast predictions are based on statistical analysis methods, which factor in variables such as differences in billing cycle lengths, subscriber base growth speed, actual and expected churn rates, as well as subscriber recovery ratio.

Subscription merchants typically combine a couple of revenue streams and distribution channels within a single store, so they need even more careful inventory and budget planning to cater for that. Being able to see how much demand for specific products they can expect, e.g. next month is key to avoid either under- or overstocking and the issues they entail.

Going to Subscription Analytics on the dashboard, merchants will now be able to see how their subscriptions are going to perform up to a month in advance in terms of revenue, retention, and active subscriptions. Using a date range selector, merchants can also narrow this down to a shorter period, like two weeks or a couple of days. They can also use a filter next to the revenue tab to switch between all orders, new subscriptions, or renewals.

And soon merchants will also be able to see similar predictions for other metrics, like their current subscriber retention, number of subscriptions, new subscribers and even the most popular products, leading to more organized and sustainable inventory management.

**Adding products to existing subscriptions**

Being able to add more items to existing subscriptions is a great way to delight subscribers and let them experiment (not to mention AOV). Up till now, only merchants were able to add products to subscriptions for their subscribers. Customer support-wise, it was far from ideal.

So, with this week’s update, also subscribers will be able to add new products to their existing subscriptions themselves, anytime, in the Customer Portal. To keep the add experience flexible, they will also be able to decide if they want to add a product permanently to their subscriptions, or just add it to the next order to give it a try first.

While adding new products, subscribers will also retain their existing loyalty benefits (like bulk or loyalty discounts), for a more subscription experience. This feature will be available by default for all Juo merchants starting from this week.

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added the Summary block for the Build-a-box functionality

<Update label="2023-06-16" description="Launching: Subscription Analytics">
  ![Subscription Analytics](/assets/updates/2023-06-16/subscription-analytics.png)

A quick pulse-check of the main subscription metrics may allow merchants to assess if they are at a profit. But to craft a long-term subscription strategy and assess its effectiveness, they will need much more insight than that.

That’s why we’re launching a Subscription Analytics dashboard that enables merchants to go a layer deeper and observe how their subscription KPIs grow over time.

Top-level metrics, like revenue, retention, or number of active subscriptions still give merchants a clear idea of how their subscription offering is faring. But then, they can track the progress day by day, month by month or year by year, either in broad or by focusing on a narrower date range to get a more detailed picture.

They can also zoom in on subscription-oriented metrics, and see how their volume of active and retained subscriptions increases with every subscription cycle. There are a few product-oriented metrics as well to easily check which SKUs are doing the best subscription-wise — and an Activity log for a quick glance into the recent subscription activity. To see these changes, just log in to Juo and open the new Dashboard.

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added subscriptions count metric checked every hour for analytical purposes
- Added Swap and Remove buttons for subscription items which have been deleted from the store in the Merchant Portal
- Improved layout and element spacing in the Customer Portal

<Update label="2023-06-09" description="Handling out-of-stock items">
  ![Handling out-of-stock-items](/assets/updates/2023-06-09/out-of-stock-items.png)

When the volume of subscription orders rapidly increases, both merchants and their subscribers need more robust ways to handle subscriptions with out-of-stock items.

The merchants can now allow for subscriptions to renew, regardless of whether or not they contain out-of-stock items, or wait until the out-of-stock items are available again. To choose one of the two options, go to Settings > Inventory.

The subscribers are also getting more control over their subscriptions with out-of-stock items. Whenever their subscription fails to renew due to availability issues, they will get an out-of-stock notification email, prompting them to swap or remove the said item(s) from their subscriptions. (To turn on this notification and adjust the content go to Settings > Email templates.)

After the swap or removal is confirmed, the subscription will automatically renew. The subscribers will also be able to check if their subscriptions contain out-of-stock items and how this affects their subscription renewals in the Customer Portal.

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added the possibility to remove items from subscription boxes in the Merchant Portal
- Added the possibility to capture reasons for failed renewals, including removed or out-of-stock items
- Added new email template for subscriptions containing out-of-stock items
- Added information about recent renewals to the subscription view and confirmation dialog in the Customer Portal
- Added information about renewal failure due to removed or out-of-stock items to the Merchant and Customer Portals

- Added a safety mechanism to prevent customers from accidentally editing their subscriptions twice in the Customer Portal
- Added debug IDs to sourcemap files
- Improved the settings for handling subscriptions with out-of-stock items in the Merchant Portal
- Changed the subscription renewal attempt schedule to match the billing attempt schedule for removed or out-of-stock items
- Changed the timeout duration for subscription renewal from 10 to 20 seconds
- Fixed an issue in which replacing an item in subscription failed due to conflict with billing cycle processing
- Fixed an issue in which unauthorized requests from the Customer Portal resulted in internal server error instead of unauthorized error
- Fixed an issue in which the direct login link redirected back to the login form in the Customer Portal
- Fixed an issue where the "Renew Now" feature was timing out because it was waiting too long for billing status information
  </Update>

<Update label="2023-06-02" description="Introducing variable discounts">
  ![Variable discounts](/assets/updates/2023-06-02/variable-discounts.png)

New discount features have been on our roadmap for some time now, but requests from merchants made us ship them faster. On top of fixed discounts for subscription orders, we’re now adding a completely new type: variable discounts. This new feature allows merchants to add percent-off discounts that will increase (or decrease) after a given number of subscription cycles. In the MVP version, the merchants can choose the initial and the updated discount and the number of orders before it’s updated.

The discount amount and the interval can both be set up during selling plan creation, under Discounts. For greater control, the enhanced version will also allow to specify how much the discount should increase or decrease with each subscription order (to be launched soon).

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added billing entries for different transaction types to improve billing granularity
- Added support for multiple pricing policies in subscription plans to enable discounts based on the number of renewals
- Improved the selling plan creation modal in the Merchant Portal
- Improved the appearance of the Customer Portal settings input forms to match those in the Merchant Portal

- Fixed an issue in which some management options were not visible in the Customer Portal
- Fixed an issue in which the languages in parts of the notification emails did not match
- Fixed an issue in which new orders containing more than 10 line items failed to process
- Fixed incorrect subscription contract id formatting which caused errors in Shopify API queries
  </Update>

<Update label="2023-05-26" description="Launching subscriber retention flow">
  ![Retention Flow](/assets/updates/2023-05-26/retention-flow.png)

Keeping retention rates high is at the core of any successful subscription brand. The new retention flow in Juo helps delight and retrieve a hesitant subscriber who attempts to cancel their subscription. Merchants can choose how to handle cancellation requests and combat churn by offering a one-time, n-time, or a permanent discount to subscribers, who can then keep their subscriptions with an extra % off. The discount and the message that goes with it can be set up in the Settings tab, under Retention.

**New Customer Portal customizations**

The subscriber-facing side of Juo got a major revamp and now it adjusts itself automatically to the storefront design. To keep things even more flexible for merchants, we’re giving them full control over the look and feel and the management options available in the Customer Portal.

Following this update, the merchants can further adjust the colors and style of key UI elements (like buttons or inputs). They can also decide which actions should be available to their subscribers, turning on or off product, delivery, and subscription management options in the Customer Portal. To adjust them, go to Subscription settings Customer Portal.

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added a safety mechanism to prevent merchants from accidentally editing their subscriptions twice in the Merchant Portal
- Changed the renewal job timeout for editing subscriptions in the Merchant Portal from 60 to 10 seconds

- Fixed an issue in which changing the subscription cycle failed because the renewal date was in the past in the Merchant and Customer Portals
- Fixed an issue in which the merchant was not redirected to the Tiered discount editing page after adding a new discount in the Merchant Portal
- Fixed an issue in which the subscription management requests were completed before the renewal jobs were properly registered for subscriptions
- Fixed an issue in which product indexes were not being removed when removing products from Shopify
  </Update>

<Update label="2023-05-19" description="Revamping the Customer Portal">
  ![New Customer Portal](/assets/updates/2023-05-19/juo-customer-portal.png)

The number of subscribers who manage their subscriptions in Juo has grown a lot in the past few weeks. How they can do it impacts the subscriber experience directly, so the quality here cannot be compromised. That’s why we’re introducing a sleeker, mobile-first Customer Portal, which makes subscription management more streamlined and more intuitive than ever.

This brand new design is also brand compliant, which means the merchants don’t have to worry about matching the look and feel to their storefronts. The color scheme and fonts will just adjust to their current themes automatically.

**More management options in the Merchant Portal**

We’re pushing further with the new additions to the Merchant Portal that add another layer of information around the payments and dunning. Now, merchants will always be able to see if and when the payment went through thanks to handy statuses that display right under the payment method in the subscription details view. If it didn’t go through, they will also see the date of the next retry and current retry attempts. The next step? More flexibility and control over the dunning flow.

With the new update, the merchants can also generate a link to the Customer Portal and log into it as any of their subscribers. Thanks to that, they can not only preview what their subscribers are seeing when they log in, but also will be able to help them with some more advanced settings or requests.

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added a 10-minute delay before renewing a subscription after any changes are made to avoid duplicate renewals due to mistakes
- Added a waiting period for payment processing to finish before refreshing the subscription view in the Merchant and Customer Portal
- Added an option to redirect from the public app to the custom app when both are installed in the store

- Changed the isolation method from iframe to web component in the Customer Portal
- Fixed an issue in which the “free shipping” label was showing the price instead on the subscriptions list page in the Customer Portal
- Fixed an issue in which the scroll position remained the same when moving to a different page in the Customer Portal
- Fixed an issue in which the subscription payment status label was displaying the subscription status instead
- Fixed the issue in which the currency format was displayed incorrectly for certain locale and currency pairs in the Merchant and Customer Portals
- Fixed the reset CSS in the Customer Portal
- Fixed input type for base_fee and transaction_fee in the database
  </Update>

  </Update>

<Update label="2023-05-05" description="Merchant Portal redesign">
  We’re going live with a new Merchant Portal design: more polished, more modern, and bringing all the key subscription information to the fore. The product list is now at the top, right where the merchants need it for straightforward product and discount management. The shipping method and subscription cycle information are laid out in separate boxes under the products to make tracking and editing less of a fuss.

The merchants will now also find the subscription cost and total lifetime value right under the subscription ID — so they’re always in the know about how well individual subscriptions fare in terms of LTV. To see all these new additions, just navigate to the Subscriptions tab and open any selected subscription.

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added a mode (disabled by default) to embed the Customer Portal without an iframe, and a modern CSS reset for better theme integration

- Added GTM integration

  </Update>

<Update label="2023-04-28" description="Custom selling plans and notes">
  We’re adding more flexibility to manage existing subscriptions this week. Merchants can now set custom selling plans with individualized delivery intervals for each subscriber.

Also, merchants can now add notes to each subscription, e.g., special customer requests or important information to remember about. Anything that matters to improve subscriber experience. Notes will be automatically added to all subsequent orders.

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added an API endpoint to create a custom delivery price in a subscription contract
- Added customer panel to the subscription view in the Merchant Portal

- Fixed labels for the Billing & Delivery column on the Subscriptions list in the Merchant Portal
  </Update>

<Update label="2023-04-21" description="Public app status">
  Today, we're excited to announce that after an unsurprisingly smooth review, Juo has become a public app on the Shopify App Store. Still in beta, still working in stealth with selected merchants, hence still temporarily unlisted, but officially public. The new status will allow us to ship new platform features faster and in a much more convenient way for merchants.

**New discounts options for merchants**

Treating each subscriber individually is key to retention. With Juo's new functionality, merchants can now add discounts at the subscription level. Discounts can be applied once, several times, or permanently for a given subscription or particular products in it. This option can also be used to grant subscribers a free product—simply add a product to the subscription with a 100% discount.

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added information to the Theme Customization mode to notify merchants when the Subscription Widget is added to a product that has no selling plans available
- Added the possibility to set different scopes for different custom apps
- Added locale detection based on the currently selected locale in the Shopify store
- Added a new, more informative header panel to subscription view in the Merchant Portal

- Fixed a flash of unstyled content before the skeleton loader
  </Update>

<Update label="2023-04-07" description="Managing multi-subscription customers">
  For larger stores with multiple subscription orders, tracing these orders back to individual subscribers can be a real hurdle. We’re now making it easier for merchants to get an overview and manage their multi-subscription customers under the new “Subscribers” tab. The tab contains a list of all subscribers, along with the number of active subscriptions they have, and their current status.

The merchants can also display and update additional details about each subscriber (like shipping and payment information or their current order info), by clicking the “Manage” link next to each subscriber’s name. To keep these things accessible, the new tab sits right under Dashboard in Juo.

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added an option to add products to subscriptions in the Merchant Portal
- Enabled billing for the public app
- Switched to Shopify product picker when changing subscription products in the Merchant Portal

- Fixed an issue in which per application settings were being merged together
- Fixed an issue in which JSON was shown instead of an error page in the Merchant Portal
  </Update>

<Update label="2023-03-31" description="Onboarding flow for new merchants">
  ![Onboarding flow](/assets/updates/2023-03-31/juo-onboarding.png)

We focused more on self-service this week with the new onboarding flow that the merchants can follow to get started with subscriptions without dev assistance. The onboarding flow covers 3 steps that every merchant needs to perform to create a working subscription offer: (1) creating a selling plan, (2) installing the subscription widget on their product page, and (3) adding a link to Manage subscriptions to their login screen.

More tricky steps (2) and (3) are covered in Help articles that are linked under the respective onboarding sections, so if anyone gets stuck, they can watch a how-to video or follow a step-by-step guide to get back on track. Note that the merchants who are already actively selling subscriptions (and so have performed these steps) will not see the onboarding. New merchants will find it on the Dashboard.

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added more data points (paused and cancelled subscriptions, revenue) to the Dashboard in the Merchant Portal
- Added an option to edit the subscription plan in the Merchant Portal

  </Update>

<Update label="2023-03-24" description="New ways to adjust products in subscription">
  This week we’re adding more flexibility and ease to how merchants and subscribers can manage their active subscriptions. With this update, both groups can easily change the number of products in subscription with just one click and the remove and swap functionalities for the subscribed products are now easily accessible from the subscription details view in the Customer and Merchant Portals.

The swap functionality got a major upgrade, too — and now uses product suggestions on top of the classic search. Whenever the merchant or subscriber wants to swap a product, different variants of this product are being suggested to make the replacement easier. The product tiles under swap now also show more information about the product variant, quantity and price, so there’s no doubts about what’s being changed for what and how this affects the price.

**More flexible handling out-of-stock items**

So far, subscriptions would only automatically renew if they contained no out-of-stock items. For out-of-stock items, renewals attempts were made for 3 months, followed with a cancellation. Now, the merchants who experience frequent stock fluctuations can decide if they want to let subscriptions with out-of-stock items renew automatically, or not. To enable this feature, just check “Renew when products out of stock” under Settings. Once it’s active, the subscriptions containing out-of-stock items will be renewed and charged according to the billing plan, and then processed and shipped by the merchants independently as the missing items become available again.

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added eligibility for subscriptions information in the Merchant Portal
- Added empty states on the Dashboard in the Merchant Portal
- Added support for product edits to migrated subscriptions
- Added an endpoint for subscription line removal

- Fixed an issue in which spacebar didn't work in the product search in the Merchant Portal
- Fixed an issue in which "0 more" was shown for subscriptions with just one item in the Merchant Portal
- Fixed an issue in which fake data was displayed instead of the skeleton loading in the Merchant Portal
- Fixed an issue in which fake data flashed on screen before the skeleton loader kicked in
  </Update>

  </Update>

<Update label="2023-03-10" description="Enabling no-code widget customization">
  To make the subscription experience seamlessly integrate with the merchants’ storefront, we’re adding more customization options to the subscriptions widget. Some examples: background and text color, font weights, purchase option labels, and even the USP messaging. In order to start customizing, simply go to the Shopify theme editor and add the new widget to the product page.

On top of that, the widget now loads up and operates much quicker, so it’s always there when the subscribers need it\!

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added an option to change products in subscription in the Merchant Portal
- Added visual feedback to buttons performing a long running action

  </Update>

<Update label="2023-03-03" description="Cart subscriptions">
  We’ve got something cool for merchants looking to boost LTV this week. Cart subscriptions make it super simple for customers to buy all their cart items at the same time in subscription.

To activate this feature, simply add the Subscribe Cart widget next to, under, or above the Checkout button to the Cart page template. Once active, customers will see a “Turn into subscription” checkbox and will be able to turn their cart content into a recurring order. And now they’re no longer customers, they’re subscribers.

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added information about applied discounts to the Subscriptions view
- Fixed an issue in which shipping calculations for subscriptions were using regular prices instead of discounted ones
- Improved the look and feel of the subscriptions list in the Customer Portal
- Added a generic error message toast following failed API requests in the Customer Portal
- Fixed an issue in which Subscription UI extension form stopped working at all
  </Update>

<Update label="2023-02-24" description="Local delivery and pickup for subscriptions">
  Flexible shipping options can make or break a subscription, so we’re tackling some of the delivery challenges this week, by making local pickup and local delivery functions available for subscriptions.

Thanks to local pickup, merchants can define additional, local pickup points, where subscribers can pick up their subscription orders quicker and more conveniently. With local delivery, merchants can also specify the entire areas to which they deliver, based on a distance from their location or on area codes. Both can be set up in Shopify settings and will now also work for subscriptions.

**Subscribers can edit shipping methods**

In the spirit of making Subscribers’ lives easier, we’re now giving them the possibility to modify their current subscription delivery method. If your Subscriber wants to change their pickup point or go from, say, InPost to DHL, they can easily do so via the Customer portal (provided that both options are available, of course). That’s more freedom for them, less hassle for you.

**Improvements and fixes**

- New discount type: Free product (Shopify Plus only)
- Added subscription contract update to include automatic discounts

  </Update>

<Update label="2023-02-17" description="Post-cancellation flow">
  We’ve been working on the post-cancellation email flow this past week, improving the subscribers’ experience and putting the merchants more in control. Now, when a subscriber chooses to cancel their subscription, they will automatically receive a confirmation email. When it’s the merchant who cancels, they can choose to either send the confirmation email to the subscriber, or not. The update is available for all merchants automatically, but you can adjust the email behavior in Settings.

**Improvements and fixes**

  </Update>

<Update label="2023-02-10" description="New subscriber login view">
  ![New login view](/assets/updates/2023-02-10/new-login-view.png)

The Customer Portal login screen got a slight design revamp. Thanks to the latest adjustments, it looks more subtle and is more compliant with the store branding, even without any additional customizations.

**More detailed membership listing**

For merchants who like a quick overview of how their subscriptions perform, the listing view for Memberships now features a few extra details to help them stay on top of everything:

- Membership: Shows membership status (Active, Inactive, Expired)
- Subscription (Former Status): Shows subscription status
- Expires on: Shows membership expiration (end) date

**Improvements and fixes**

- Fixed Memberships not appearing on orders list due to the Shopify query error
- Minor UI improvements to Tiered discounts in the app
- Improved the stability of the product picker for various edge-cases, now it works correctly in all corner-cases

- Subscribers can check shipping costs in the Customer Portal
- Next payment date is no longer shown for inactive subscriptions
- Increased latency period on “Renew now” button to prevent accidental renewals
- Fixed the browser’s back / forward buttons behavior in the Merchant Portal
  </Update>

<Update label="2023-01-27" description="Minimum required renewals">
  To prevent subscribers from canceling their subscriptions too quickly, merchants can set up a minimum number of renewals to take place before a subscription can be modified. So, subscribers and merchants will only be able to cancel, pause, or skip a subscription after it has been renewed at least so many times.

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added charge retry date to the Customer and Merchant Portals
- Added remove Tiered discounts functionality
- Improved the UI for Tiered discounts
  </Update>

- Fixed delivery frequency format
  </Update>

<Update label="2022-12-30" description="Customizable email notifications">

<Update label="2022-12-23" description="Premium memberships (a.k.a. Clubs)">
  With Memberships, merchants can build their own premium clubs (similar to Amazon Prime or Allegro Smart) with free deliveries or discounts as the main incentives. Except for custom implementations, we’re pretty sure you won’t find this feature anywhere else\!

**Improvements and fixes**

- Fixed empty shipping line check for value
- Default interval for selling plans changed from 1 week to 1 month
  </Update>

<Update label="2022-12-16" description="More freedom to edit subscriptions">
  Except for adding and removing products from subscriptions, merchants can also swap products within a subscription (one condition: both the old and the new product have to be in the same selling plan).

Subscribers can change, remove, or add products to their subscription entirely on their own in the Customer Portal.

**Automatic tagging for subscription order**

All subscription orders will now automatically receive a `subscription_*` tag to help merchants search, filter, and analyze how their subscriptions perform. Tags can also be used to create targeted, subscriber-only marketing campaigns.

- `subscription_start` for initial order
- `subscription_order_NUMBER` for all orders
- `subscription_CONTRACT_ID` for all orders

**Improvements and fixes**

- Added links to individual orders in the subscription activity timeline
- Added "Show all orders" link to see all orders from a given subscriber
  </Update>

<Update label="2022-12-09" description="Subscriber-scheduled renewals">
  Rather than skipping a replenishment, subscribers can now just pick a different date for their next subscription renewal. Convenient\! They can also change the delivery frequency, choosing one of the alternative frequencies available for their subscription.

**Improvements and fixes**

- Improved Customer Portal layout spacing on mobile
- Improved popup positioning for better user experience in the Customer Portal
- Fixed an error where merchants could only add 10 products to a selling plan
  </Update>

<Update label="2022-12-02" description="Flexible login options for subscribers">
  Subscribers have more flexibility logging into their customer accounts. They can choose between a code sent to their email, social sign-in with Google, or Facebook. If subscribers are logged in to their customer account already, they can just go directly to their subscription settings from there — no additional login is required.

**Full Polish language support**

For Polish-speaking merchants and subscribers out there, Polish is now fully supported on the storefront and in email notifications. The language used is based on the language settings in Shopify.

**Improvements and fixes**

- When subscription fails to renew, both subscribers and merchants receive an email notification
