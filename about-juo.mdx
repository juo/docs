## What is Juo?

Juo is a workflow-based subscription platform created to help modern ecommerce brands turn one-time shoppers into lifelong subscribers.  
The philosophy is simple: give merchants and developers the freedom to design any recurring-revenue experience while keeping the customer journey fast, friendly, and fully on-brand.

With Juo you can launch Subscribe & Save plans with progressive discounts, curate boxes and workflows that automatically swap SKUs or handle replenishment, offer build-a-box experiences with custom layouts, run memberships that unlock exclusive perks, surface personalised upsells before each renewal, and deploy retention flows that combine incentives, cancellation logic, and analytics.

Juo amplifies customer lifetime value by giving merchants total control over every step of the subscriber journey.
