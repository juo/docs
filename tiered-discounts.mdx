Tiered discounts is a feature in Juo that allows you to offer volume discounts on selected items, based on the number of items your customers add to cart.

## Create a new Tiered discount

You can manage your discounts under **Experiences** > **Tiered discounts**. To get started with discount creation, click on the “Set up tiered discounts” button.

Once on the **Tiered discounts** tab, click the **Add discount** button at the top.

Start the discount creation process

## Provide discount details

There are a few details that need to be provided to enable Tiered discounts.

### Title

This is the label assigned to your discount. It will only be visible to you, so choose a name that helps you identify the discount later on.

### Discount code

This field allows you to input the discount code for your Tiered discount offer. This code will be visible to your customers in the cart and checkout once they have added enough eligible products.

### Discount status

Set the active status if you want to apply the Tiered discount in your store immediately upon finishing the setup. You can also use this setting to activate or deactivate it periodically when you need to.

### Combine with other discounts

Tiered discounts can also be combined with other discounts in your store:

* Product discounts — discounts that apply to individual products in your store, apart from tiered discounts
* Shipping discounts — discounts that apply to shipping
* order discounts — other discounts set up in your store that apply to the entire order

Here, you can select which of these discounts can be applied simultaneously (either automatically or by entering them manually in checkout).

* Apply to subscriptions — this option applies Tiered discounts to subscription orders (on top of one-time orders)

Once you’re finished with this part of the setup, click **Add** to create the new discount.

Provide the details of your discount first

## Set up discount tiers

Next, you can set up the discount tiers. Click on the **Add** button to get started.

First, pick the number of products that will activate a certain tier, next, choose the corresponding discount. Hit save, and the first tier is set up.

You can set up multiple discount tiers in the same manner. There are no limits to the number of tiers you can create, but having 3-5 should be enough for more stores and contexts.

Next, define the discount tiers

## Choose eligible products

Finally, select the products (or product variants) to which the Tiered discount should apply.

Whenever the customer adds a required number of eligible products to their carts, the corresponding discount will be applied automatically.
