By default, Juo uses shipping rates defined by your currently active shipping profile in Shopify. If you’d like to use different rates for subscriptions, create a dedicated shipping profile.

Don’t add any products to this shipping profile. Reach out to Juo team once the rates are configured properly, and we will make sure that they are is applied to all subscription orders and renewals.

In the Merchant Portal, you can edit shipping rates for individual subscriptions. ![Screenshot 2025-03-06 at 16.59.53.png](https://cdn.juo.io/content-uploads/Screenshot_2025_03_06_at_16_59_53_d72fd02f4b.png)

More advanced shipping rules are possible. You can reward your subscribers with free shipping after X order using [Extras](https://juo.io/docs/extras). Subscription experiences like [Build-a-Box](https://juo.io/docs/adding-build-a-box) or [Custom Workflows](https://juo.io/docs/custom-workflows) also have their own Shipping settings.

## Mixed cart shipping rates setup

For mixed cart containing both subscription and one-time products, Shopify will use both rates. If subscription orders have free shipping, it can lead to customers paying for shipping if they add one-time products to the order. To avoid it, a mix cart setup has to be configured.

Mix cart shipping rates setup requires using three delivery profiles:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="General profile">
    - Used for one-time purchases
    - It cannot have conditional prices. To set the correct rates, use automated shipping discount
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Recurring checkout profile">
    - Juo team will create this profile
    - Same shipping rates as the General profile
    - Additionally, it must have an additional free shipping rate. It must always be the first rate on the alphabetically sorted list.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="(optional) Recurring profile">
    - Juo team will create this profile
    - Used for subscription renewals
    - Only needed if recurring rates should be different than the first order
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
